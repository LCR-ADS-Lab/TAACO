agree, with to be yourself in a world is constantly trying to make something else is the greatest accomplishment. by doing this you will improve more in life. trying to become a better person and help you in some ruff time trying to be a better person its going to be hard if you still not going to improve on what you want to do in life for example i was working with my uncle doing roofing an he told me to do this side an i did an i messed up so many time and he taught me how to do it and now i improve what i did wrong. working an improving it better then doing nothing in life to putting effect to improve .

to improve in life you can ask people whats better and learning more at school. dont try to be with people that you know they going to bring you down foccess on your improvement so then you can follow your dreams an go on and you can accomplishment and improve something in life which they can help other and you can help something out in your life my conclusion is, if you trying to improve something or want to do better success on what you trying to accomplishment there for you can get out of school out early and start woring on what your going to improve and you can become smarter to do more things and help you out
