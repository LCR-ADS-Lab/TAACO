Most student enjoy summer vacaction,but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that student do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall.

Most of the student have reason that is to much break during summer break, but I am disagree with the idea of change the schedule of vacaction time. Could be during summer break the student forget some information of school, but all student wait for summer because much student like to travel to their country during vacation time, or some student only can see their family during summer break and their like to pass time with them, I guess is better time to take vacation in summer. Also the eductors need to think about the thing they can do during summer break because during winter the weather is really bad and also is too much snow and is too cool for to go out side.

Another reason that why is bad idea to get break during winter is because in winter the job is slow, and the center recreational are close like the pool, beach, park, and the fair. I think 3-4 week break during summer is a little be of time to have fun with the family, and enjoy their vacation I dont see the main point of the change because if they change the longer break for winter it take the same time because they also want that student take a week break durin spring and falls; Is more complicated if they change the schedule.

Therefore is a bad idea to change because it should be the same way it doesnt matter what time or what station is the break it should be the same way, because if they do in winter they going to forget information, eather is not good idea because the student cant enjoy their break for the weather.

In conclution I am desagree with the idea and is better during summer break, because could be the same time that the student loose.
