I think working in a group is more efficiently and helpful then working alone. In these paper i will argue about the benefice of working in a group. Working in group is better because we can share ideas, prepare us for the real world, and save time.

If we work in groups, we can share information, ideas and thoughts. We can see what its better for our teamwork and the assignment that we were doing in school or jobs. I think the most of the jobs in the real world are in groups, however, when i work in the mechanic shop with my dad and brothers, an i'm replacing a engine, i need their help because it takes strange, agility and experience to replaced it, because it's really hard for only one person to do it, so it's important to learn how to work in group, these skills prepare and help us for the real world by working like a team or family group. The army, police officer and government are some good examples of groups, they work together to finish their work and see the benefices of working in group. Doing work as a team is not a waste of time, we share the responsibilities,so it would not be the much work for only one person. Two or more people is a good combination of beneficial and fast work.

some say that working alone is better then working in group, but they wrong because when we work in groups is more easy by sharing thought with friend and partners, we get to now each other and makes new friends, that is the way how people get better in life by working in groups. Working in groups make people to put more effort and attention in what they are doing because we want to get better opportunities in life, good greats and chances of getting a great job.
