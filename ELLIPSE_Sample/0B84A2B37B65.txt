On my opinion, I agree what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, i agree what author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because if you try to do something with less beyond that is already master you will never grow because you still doing the same thing that is already master, you never go advance, you have to do new things and Lear new things on the way you grow doing news things. Many people do the same thing they don't do news things they have to do news things to Lear news things

If you train to do something that is already made, you loosing your time, on the time that you are loosing you can do news thing doing other things, we don't have to do the same things always.

I take my position on that and i think what the Author Waldo Emerson wrote is right about what hi wrote.

It is important to do news things because you learning news things doing differents things
