When I get their I going to see the near by place to eat because I want to tasted the flavor of the Argentina food because they have good food but I cant name them they have a wear name. However after that I want to go and visit the soccer field take some pictures were the famous player play. and finally l will pay for an hotel to sleep because Im going to be tiredly for all the amazing thing that i did all day long. I dont know but I will like to know if is true that Argentina has good money.?
