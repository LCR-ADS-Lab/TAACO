I believe that student they need to take this class because is elective and is its important for all student.

Art class is one of the class more beautiful because every person to learning a large.

Music class, required more time you need to effort its is difficult for some students is for this reason they dont like to take music class.

the drama class this class is help each other student that don't understand; Teacher have a good opportunity to communication. Have event on the school. Friday or Saturday night.

1) I am agree that the student take this class. I thing this class help to us for the graduation also is important to take others class that the students like for a good grade because they dont permit failure the level. if every students change the class they have your responsibility, this 3 class are good is not difficult. On my opinion art class you only learning about different color of flowers, animal and colors a wonderful letter. I understand that some people believe that students should be required to take a music, a drama, and art class. On my reason some students on your schedule have your class electives of the school is depend each Pearson required to change of class electives students need respect wherever class get on your schedule, sometime student get the same class every year of the school is because students change the class possible that to take for the ESOL test and they need to get the same class agent. My specific example abut this prompt is:

Students dont change of electives class is for a good reasons you have.
