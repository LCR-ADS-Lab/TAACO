Introduction

I think working alone is more beneficial for me than as a group.

First reason its better to be alone because I get more work done and i feel that I concetrate more than being as a group.

working alone it helps me to concetrate on what am doing. Also working by myself I helps me to focus on what am writing

Second Reason Being Alone more ideas comes to my mind. The more music i hear the more i get done.

We all take decisions on the ideas we want for the project , homework, ECT. One person or two is better to slve a problem or to give ideas. Reason Three The Group requires comunication between them. Facts : Without communication the ideas can be wrong and no take a good grade. Secon they'll be maybe mad to each other. your teamate can help you see different things that you couldn't see. we all have experience but some people have more than us.

Inclonclusion It's better to work with team that without one, more ideas different ideas, more creativity. thats all peace.
