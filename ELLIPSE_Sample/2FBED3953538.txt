In my opinion, I do not support the four-day school week. I think it is unreasonable. The only good thing for that is the long week. Student will revice a very long weekend to reward their hard work.

First of all, national sets up five-day school week must having their own reason which make this reasonable. The short school time a day gives us more space and time to join in or do many activites. For me, I will use these time to take voluteer job, play basketball and ping-pang with my friends. Beside, I will use these time to finish my homework or prepare the next day test. After that, I will have much time to do my own stuff. And I will recive a 2 days weekend to take a rest. It makes me having enough and flexble time to do what I want to do which is also helpeful. This seems prefect time schedule. However, there must be some against sound will say that the long weekend is better. But what they do not know which is the total time won't change,

they still got same study time as before. On the other hand, the four-day study week would increasing the work on each day, if they used to be that form schedule, they will not have time to do the school activites or homework. The time and space is too tight. Furthermore, the three days weekend will effect the body condition when they come back to school on Monday. They are still stucking in the long weekend, on their happly trip, fun video game and so on. They are going to forget everything they learned last week. The heavy study druing a short time and over break is unheal.

Acorrding those reasons I listed, a four-day school week must be a bad idea, it is helpless. So I think the four day school week shound not use in school.
