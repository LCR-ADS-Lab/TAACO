Yes there should be one way to improve student achievement to start an after school homework club in my school, because there's allot of student that really need help on there homework, teacher should stay with student that need help with that class homework so they can understand more what there learning in there classroom so they don't get confused on that time of a test, they can get a good score because they have study with there homework and they have get allot of help from there teachers. But some student don't like doing homework when that teacher ask them if they should stay with them student don't even stay after school and that teacher gets really mad because some times they takes time that day to stay with a students and they don't even show up.

Teacher take time of there social life to help student for there homework to do good on there report card because some teacher care about homework that student needs to complete it on time or that teacher give them more time and they still don't even do it that's why some teacher don't give no extra time any more, that teacher tell them if they want a A's or F's on there report card because they don't finish there homework, there should be a only homework club after school so other teacher should not stay and do work for that next day, but someone student throw there homework on that trashcan because they don't care about how hard teacher work to give them a good education to stay after school.

Some student understand that homework and finish really early, that student should help other on there homework and do a after school club and help each other on what they do need help on,but went teacher let student help each other they only like playing or talk and not even help with that homework, but if they don't know each other they do finish and help, but some student don't like went someone else is helping them because they don't explains how a teacher will explains to them because some student only give them that answer and that how they don't like other student helping them because some teacher ask how they got that answer and they don't event know how to explain to a teacher that how that teacher know that they copy someone else.

Student achievement will grow allot bigger if they start after school club teacher and student volunteer to help other that are really begin of homework and other works will help them if there was a only homework club because some student don't even do it because they dont understand or they forget to do it but if they do it after school there not going to have to much difficulty on there homework any more, some subjects don't have homework but went they don't do that homework they talk to that teacher that they had allot of homework and they forgot to that homework but they don't even try do work on it. some teacher try to help them to do it but they still don't even try to do it, they rather get a bad grade and not do that homework.

Some student want to finish their homework early went they have time they like to do it during class time because they don't like staying after school in class they ask that teacher for help or other student in that class because they finish there work on time and don't have any thing to do so they start finishing that homework so they don't need stay or finish it at home they can rest and don't worry about homework or they can stay after school and finish with that that student that finish on time and if they don't like working with other student they can stay with a teacher, some teacher like other student helping other because some teacher think that helping each other will understand more and they will ask question to each other to learn what there were doing in class.

Allot of student will improve there grades and there will do there homework early if teacher call there parent to stay after school to do homework allot will finish early and they will not feel that they got do allot of homework at home some student go home and play and they forget that they have homework to do, there mom ask them if they have homework and they answer with a no but went a teacher call them to stay after school that there kids have not do any homework in that class, that they have a F's in that class because they don't finish that homework on time and they don't care about if they need to finish that homework, after school teacher should award student for staying after and finish there work on time so they can feel happy that there grades are going up.

After school club in other school will help allot of student to do got on any test because homework helps allot to study and do good on any class but if you don't try to do your homework your going to have difficulty went it's time to take a test because you haven't even doing not of your homework or not even staying after school club, other school don't like doing homework clubs because they think that everyone understand that homework because know one ask for any help and never brings homework to class teacher thinks that they don't like do it, or they tell that teacher they forgot it home and that teacher believed on them and they get a good grade but don't even do it,some student volunteer to meet with those who either have difficulty and other student don't even stay other student takes time always to help other and other don't even thanks those student.
