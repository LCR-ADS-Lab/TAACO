Some school districts offer programs that allow allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. I think students should be offered the opportunity to graduate in three years so they can go to college or join the work force early.

A program that offers you three years of high school has so many benefits and advantages. Its a great option, because who doesnt want to be done with high school one year early and come out ready to pursue their career or dream? It's not only about finishing school early, but in that year you also have the advantage to be offered jobs or be hired over somebody else for example, if you were competing for a job in fixing computers you would have the more experience, knowledge, and advanced while the other guy just came out of high school and is new to the work force.

This program gives you the option to have a flexible schedule and to choose whats best for your comfort. Taking courses over the summer and not being able to take electives can help you finish more early and to be available to plans for the future. You will have so much time to invest in activities that your interested or visit colleges you wish to go to, because remember your graduating early and you have to be ready for this life changing experience.

Having an extra year of high school is waste not just of your time but a waste of your life! Your a senior in high school and your friend who took the early college program has the same career choice like you do, but he graduated last year, has more experience, many job offers, and good pay, while your in class listening to a history channel on the television. His friend made the decision to apply for early college and took advange of it.

Success is the key in life and taking this opportunity is the key that will take you further in life and your in your career. If you have the option to apply for this program be wise and take this life changing opportunity.
