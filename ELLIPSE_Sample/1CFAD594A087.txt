In a world of 7 billion is hard being yourself, because everyone else is trying to make you something you are not. It might be hard to be yourself, express yourself and have your own opinion , because there's so many people that try to make to you different or make you think in a different way, even the government want's to choose for you.

You can be yourself, being yourself means to express your feelings to the world but in your own unique way, for example LGBT people they are the people that get the most stuff at them because of who they love, and the stuff they believe in.

People constantly keep trying to make them different, even the government is trying to tell them who they can love and who they can not love, who they can marry, and who they cant.

Expressing yourself in a world of 7 billion people is not easy, because everyone has different opinions and beliefs, you might have different ways to express yourself than your family and that is hard, because when you are young you believe in the same stuff your parents/family does, but the older you get you start to understand more stuff and why your parents believe in what they believe in.

Your own opinion matters do not let other people make you think your opinion does not matter or that it ain't important, you have the freedom of speech in the U.S., meaning you have the freedom to say anything you want to who you want in a whatever way you need to say or express it.

To be yourself in this world it's hard but do not let anybody ruin that for you, if your friend's do not agree on who you love, then change friends, if they do not like in what you believes are, explain to them your beliefs and try to make them understand why you believe in that certain stuff.
