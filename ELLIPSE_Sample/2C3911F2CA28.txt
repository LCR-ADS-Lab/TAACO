Dear Principal,

I think we should all have a choice of doing Community Service or not, but maybe try to make a list of who would like to help us clean our community if we don't have enough kids helping maybe getting some of our parents to help... or trying to convince some other students to help us... it wont kill anybody to help once in our life...

Helping our community is a very good thing showing our planet that we do care!!

I think its important to have our community clean but some of us have things to do, but maybe we can fit this hobby in one if our days. Having a dirty community might not be so happy... because this is where we live, this is our HOME! If we have our house dirty of course we clean it up to have it nice, clean and fresh so if we have company they'll say " oh look how nice and clean they have their house"... They wont be saying bad comments.

But were not going to make them help. In this case I would help, if I don't have nothing to do in other words if I am not busy I would come and do Community Service...

I'll try convincing my friend's to come and help.

Sincerely, STUDENT_NAME.
