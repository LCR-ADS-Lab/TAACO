Is going from failure to failure the key to being successful without the loss of enthusiasm.

I believe that everyone should at least fail once or twice so that it will make them want to try harder the next time the try to do the same thing they failed at the first time they tried it so they can show that they care about something.

For example a lot of kids like to play video games so they get there parents to get it for them and when they first play it they dont know how to so they fail the first few times and thats all right because after a well they learn how to play it so the start to be successful at the game.

And it also go for a lot of teenagers and adults because when they start a new job they really dont know how to do it so they are failures until someone trains them what to do and then they start to get the hang of it and they become more successful with there jobs like when i first started my job i had no idea what to do and then the other workers at the place i work at trained me how to do the stuff there so the set me up to be successful at my job.

But everyone still fails at what they do and that is okay because everyone is not successful at what they do and that is okay because they have people to show them how to be successful at what they do.

Some examples of this: is the high school, college, the military, the government.

And the reason i picked those was because when the teachers in high school set the students up for success so they end up going to college and some students end up majoring in something the teachers taught them and others end up doing something in the government but then some of the students end up not going to college so some of them end up failing and not being able to get jobs and become criminals and some of the other students that don't end up in college either going to work a regular job or end up joining the military and making that into a career but before they do that they have to get trained on what to do so they won't mess up something and fail and everybody males mistakes it's just how they fix the mistake they made so they can turn it around and be successful in the career they choose.

So in conclusion everyone fails at what they do at least once in there life so failing more then once really is the key to success.
