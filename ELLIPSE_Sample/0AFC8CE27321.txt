By the time students enter high school, I believe that they should have an idea of what type of career they would like to pursue after they graduate. For some students, committing to a specific career at young age sometimes is a good idea as long as you have a backup idea for a different career in case you decide that you do not want to pursue in that career anymore, thats why committing to a career at a young age is only sometimes a good idea because you'll never come up with another career if you keep changing your mind. The courses that you study in high school should be thought about as well because maybe you need a specific degree from a course in order to pursue in that career.

I believe that, if a student is going to commit to a career that they should be very passionate about this career, they should be at least a junior in high school so that they've had time to get a feel of the other careers and decide which one they enjoy and suits them the best, and they should keep in mind the requirements that are needed, the benefits, and the types of jobs that it offers to them. Students who commit to a career at a young age are usually athletes, or they plan on working in their family business.

Pursuing your career needs a lot of hard work in school especially in this generation because you're going to need to go to a good college so you need a good GPA because you're going to want to go to the college that has a good academic program for the career that you plan on pursuing. Therefore, you need to go to college, and work hard so you can get a good job because most jobs, don't hire anyone without a college degree.

Finally, thats what I think about choosing the right career for yourself, and committing to a career at a young age. although some may still believe differently and disagree with my view on this issue.
