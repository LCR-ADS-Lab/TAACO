I Disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson Statement because if you already mastered what you already have done its a lot less fun because you already know what your going to do and your pretty much your doing what you already know many of times, i think its better to just do something different because you will learn something new. Your not doing what you have already mastered your learning something new if you wanna do something you wanna do. Another reasons why i disagree with this statement is that if you do something you already mastered it gets boring. I Think doing something different is a better answer then doing something you already mastered because its not boring because something different happens. I think its a better choice to do something different because what ever you decide to do your gonna do it you dont need to stick with what you already mastered. Another reason why doing something different is because everyone does something different not everyone does the same thing. This is why i think doing something different is a better answer then doing something youve already mastered.
