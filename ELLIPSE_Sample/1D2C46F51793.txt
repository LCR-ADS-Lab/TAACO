Dear: Principal

I think that all students should perform community service.

Because if there cleaning they will not litter in the first plays.

And also that will help the community, and tutor is not so bad because they get to lernd how other students lernd. And the students how don't want to do it because its wasting there time. I think they will how have fun if they help the elementary school sports times.
