If people do not try to do something beyond that they have already mastered, people will never grow? Since people start doing more things after they have already done something people grow beyond. After they get their master they still prepared for extras things because people can get more money, and get more knowledge for extras things

First reason is that people can get more money. For example, if they have already a master in any career and they still study for get another degree they will get more money. To clarify, for each degree that people have they get more money in their paycheck at their work. Thus, more degrees people have more money they get pay for.

The second reaon is that people can get more knowledge for extras things. For instance, sometimes people need some extra help in they own job because they do not know how to do the work. To be clear, if people have more masters they can be more useful at job and they will save money because in that way they would not have to pay to others. Thus, in that people will save extra money.

On the other hand people may say, that is does not matter if others have just one master in their life. For example, some people have only one master in life, but that master can be more successful that having more than one. To clarify, is depens of what type of career people choice. However, if people get more that one degree is more probable that they can learn more things than just have one master. In coclusion at any moment of life if people get another degree is will be useful.

To conclude, people develope by what they are. People can get more money in a short period of time. People get more knowledge by the time. Also people say that no matter if you have only one master because that master can be more important that others. People can stil grow after they get their master.
