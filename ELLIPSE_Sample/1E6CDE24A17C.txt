To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Our school wants to follow thus model by extending the school day. I do not agree that students should stay ten hours in school because students can feel overwhelmed, students need time for homework and sports, and students can feel tired.

First, students can feel overwhelmed if they have to stay ten hours in the school. Students can feel annoyed if they stay at school for a long time because all day learning and writing can make them angry and they will not pay attention in the class. Also, the teacher will be angry because the students do not pay attention in the class and also the students will be distracted.

Second, students can not do homework because they do not have time. Students will be tired and need sleep. Students can not participate in sports because they need more time to study and learn. Students can be distracted and do not pay attention in the class.

Next, students can feel tired because they stayed ten hours in school learning more and writing more. Students have to sleep because they need a minimum of eight hours for rest. This also can affect the students health for example they may faint because students can not sleep in the school.

Other people say students need to stay ten hours in school because students may conserve more energy and more resources and another people say students must go to the school ten hours each day because can learning more and writing.

In my opinion i do not agree that the students should stay ten hours in school because students can feel overwhelmed. Students need time for homework and sports and students can feel tired and do not pay attention in the class.
