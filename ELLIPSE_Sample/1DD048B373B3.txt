Imagination

I think that imagination is more important than knowledge. First reason, it is good for health. Second reason, if you have knowledge but you can not use it so imagination is good for that. lastly, if you imaging anything thats are real and not real it is more fun than having knowledge.

If some body is sick that she or he want to make some thing but he or she can not make it so they have to imagine what they they want to make. It help the children young and old people that are sick and they can not due things that they want . If you are not happy because you want to make something that can help the people but you can not because you don't imagine things that can help you with that thing that how you get sick so you have to imagine thing.

You have knowledge but you can not use it so you have to imagine things that can help you and your knowledge. That how you can make some thing and without imagination we are nathing in this world. Imagination make you feel good about you and you want to imagine things more.

If you imagine things that are not real thats fun and make you feel good about youre self so you want to imagine more and you can imagine any time anywhere. It is fun and children can imagine thingsmlike having there own house, buildings, and cars.

Do you now that 50% of people imagine things that are not real so why you dont imagine thing it good for you and youre family imagine all day. I imagine all day and my family to so it is good when we want to watch move we all make up a store and we tell everybody. So imagine all day.
