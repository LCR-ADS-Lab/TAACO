I think that schools should not le students use their cell phones for educational purpose, because it might effect their grades, might not focus, and the can cheat in their work.

Cell phones for educational purpose could not work because it could effect students grades. The teacher might sign up some work to do and students just stay in their phones watching social media or other things. Just being in their cell phones and not the work is goig to effect their's grades.

Cell phones for educational purpose could not work because students might not be focusing in what the teacher is saying. Not focusing in what the teacher saying and just being in their phones texting to their friend and not focusing that's not folloeing directions on what the teacher said. Not focusing in school it can cause a lot of problems in their senior year because not passing their exams they might not even graduate.

Cell phones for educational purpose could not work because students can cheat in their work. Doing work for their class for not focusing they might look the answers on the internet and when they have their finals exams and using their cell phones that's called cheating .

Some schools let students to use their cell phones for educational purpose. But they don't think that is bad because student are not going to use their phones just to do work they might be doing other things for example being in social media or texting to friends all that can cause that the student to not focus, effecting their grades, and thye might be cheating.

Other people may argued that students should use cell phones in their classrooms for educational purpose because they might have access to do work in their phones or other thing they have to in their class. But I think the opposite because students are going to do the opposite of working they might be looking for the answers or being in social media .
