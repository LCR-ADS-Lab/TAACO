I will say that i desagree with the idea of having distance learning for our's studente to take classes from their home i suggest have doing it the same way as always and have that as a better option.

first reason why: because a lot's of teacher keep their work and keep doing it as they use to and that can that many teacher don have to lose their case there might a lot of them that prefer having a classroom full of student or some others just prefer that way is easier or they like to comunicate with the student and that is something that some times can benefit the student.

second reason student can learn how to be more socialise with others students and that can make them have better comunication with other people for example it would be a lot easier to get job by them self cause that make them feel sure about them self and that make the student better on almost all their classes.

Third reason is that shools can steel be use normaly as long everything is ok with them an the steel can have a porpuse for many reson for students. but some people said that having the student take those from home by way of online or video conferencing might let some student have a more flexeble schedule because at the fact they in their home but i said this might corrupt the student learnig there might tha have acces to wifi or dont transport you know having to go to a library so that's why apik this position about having to take classes online.
