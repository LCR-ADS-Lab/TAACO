Do you really think students need cell phones during school hour. While school hours u need to learn not being on the phone the whole day.

you need to pay close attention to the teacher instead of being on the phone texting or calling someone. I don't think u need a cell phone I would just say for emergencies. Imagine being on the cell phone the whole school hours and never paying attention that just is going to make you not graduate from school just because you never payed attention because a phone. I wouldn't risk my future cause just of a phone

There's so many reasons why they shouldn't allowed cellophane's and here are some' s. first of all their very distracting. let's see while the teachers are explaining something to you and your somewhere texting or calling what are you learning NOTHING!! it's difficult to bring things back and to learn them. Learning new stuff is sometimes difficult imagine trying to learn all the thing that you missed.

Another reason is that when they grow up they aren't going to graduate because they never payed attention at school. And they wouldn't have a good career like they alwayst dreamed
