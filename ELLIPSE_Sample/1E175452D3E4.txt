Dear Principal,

I disagree with forcing everyone to do extracurricular activity, because studies have shown that people, who chose to follow their dreams will have a higher chance of success rather than being forced. The idea of this is to get people to chose their own life not by forcing them. You decided that it was best for everyone to choose an extracurricular activity, but you are forcing them to do it, and getting forced is like a war between Japan and America in World War 2, an example of this is yourself, because if you were forced you would have never been the person you are today.

You are forcing people to choose an extracurricular activity, but what if the students dont like sports or anything related to that. While it is true that, Athletes like Ronaldo or Messi is getting millions per year or higher, but they chose that path not getting forced into it. The president for example also never got forced either, he chose to do what is good for the people, and the people chose him to be the president. The president was not forced into into it, he chose that path on who he wants to be.

Everybody in this world is different some want to become a YouTube channel, others choose to be an Athlete, or something related to it, but you forcing everyone to chose an extracurricular activity is not good, cause you chose their activity, their future, their talents, and e. t.c. Keeping this up will only make things worse. Are you going to keep this up or let the students decide?
