It is a good idea to conserve anergy and rosources because we not wasted the energy that we are not gonna use.

some people use a lot energy,like if they want to take a shower they open the thing of the water,but you not in the shower and the water is on so yo are wasting a lot water and energy. There some people that need that water like in Africa some places in Africa,there's a lot of people who need resources,they don't even eat a good food, they don't even take a shower like us. While we waste all the fresh water for example;some people when they going to take a shower the first thing that they do is open water but they opene it when they are not in the shower,so the water is runnig "wasting water"when allegedly we are in the shower but we are on the toilet using the phone some stuff like that,we have to appreciate the water and all the resources that we have in our home.

In my opinion work just 4 days per week it is good but at the same time bad why? First if you work just 4 days per week its sound good but the thing is some people they take care they family like there's some people that are agree with work 4 days because the salary that they won it is good to survive with that salary. But some people with the salary that they have is not enough because they have to pay the rent the bill of the phone,the bill of the car they have to buy food to the family so i think work more then 4 days is good.

About school can we have just foud days of schools i don think so because we need education for our future.

The school can not give to us 4 days school because it is better to the students to come to the school 5 days because if we we have just 4 days of school is not good we need education for everything even with the animals.

if we have more days of school we can be more succes full in the future. Education,respect and also be nice with everyone is the key of the future.
