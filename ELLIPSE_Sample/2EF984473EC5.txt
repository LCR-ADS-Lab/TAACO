Which do you feel is more beneficial?

Do you prefer working in group or working alone? There could be many reason on either ones. As a school project, i would prefer working in group. what would you like to choose working in groups or working alone.

I choose working in group because you can task for help when it's needed. If you get stuck, you could ask your partner for help. If you done understand something , you could ask your partner for help. If you got question you could ask your partner also. If you don't know what to do you could ask your partner.

Working alone could be confusing at time. Working alone could be hard and have no help. If you got a question you have no one to ask. Also if you get stuck it could be hard to get back in track. Working alone could get stressful. Working alone is not easy, you gotta think harder.

Working in groups can be easy. Working with a partner could finish up quick. You guys could talk about it. One could be drawing while the other one could be writing. Working together will be easy when brainstorming. You guys could be doing two different things and still get it done. When working in groups establishes a better relationship.
