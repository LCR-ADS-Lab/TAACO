Do you think that schools should extend the school hours for 1 hour and 30 min? I agreee with this plan because it would help students education.

It can help students with their education:

The teachers would be able to explain more to the students so they can understand properly. Teachers can help educate the students by using the extra time to do more projects. The teachers can read more books with the class so they can be good readers and writers.

It would give students less days of school:

Students can get more relaxing time and come to school with a lot of energy. Students can get more time working on school work/homework at home during the weekend. Students wouldn't have to worry about going to school on the days that the school chooses to skip.

It can help students can get a lot smarter with extra hours:

The students can get extra time to do homework and trying to understand everything during the extra 1 hour and 30 minutes. The teachers can take the whole class to the library to check out or read books with the classroom. Students can have an extended gym time to get rid of all the energy inside them so they can learn and obtain all the information from the teachers.

I think that the extra 1 hour and 30 minutes would help students with education. It can really help the students because they get more time on their weekends and it gives them more time to study,work on homework, or finish a project. Should schools give more time for the teachers and students?
