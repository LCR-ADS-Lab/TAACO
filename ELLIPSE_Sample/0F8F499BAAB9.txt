I think it is a good idea for students to select a career at a young age by the time they enter high school.

Because for example right now I am in high schools in eleven grade and I dont know what career I want to take it.

I agree with the societies that do students expected to identify a career, at that way they are gonna know what career they want, some students likes more than one career and they dont know which to decided before they graduated..

They are others students that the career that they want it is to expanses and they don't have enough money to pay they can try to get like a scholarship with having good grades and they have to stars in nine grade with good grades and they can apply for one later and see if they can get it.

I agree that the students select a career at a young age, at that way they are prepared and when they graduated of high schools that are gonna go to college ad choose a good career,

and than after that get a good job.
