Do you want technology to take over your kid's life? Students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because it will give students a hard time to communicate with people. This is important because it is easier for students to build a friendship in the schools, some student do not have access to internet at home, and students will not be able to participate in a school's sports team.

It is easier for students to build a friendship, For example, my sister Generic_Name attended online school from first grade till HighSchool and she was always home on her computer doing homework and she did not get to meet and communicate with people and she always had a hard time trying to make new friends and make conversations with people, so my parents were always concerned about her and her mental health, so they decided to put her in a public school and at the end she was able to make new friends and spend time with them. Some people will say that "Students could make friends through Social Media too",but I believe that no one can build the trust with their friends through a phone screen, especially, student at their teenage years.

Some students do not have access to internet at home, For example, one of my friends Generic_Name did not have access to internet at home and she was home schooled so her parents had to give her ride to the public library and take her back home everyday, which they had a hard time with, and she could not really focus in the library, so she had to go back to her school after one year and she did way better than she did in her online class and she found new friends. Some people will say that " students could go to their friend's house for them to do their online classes", I believe that students will not have the time or a ride to go to their friends house, and their friends will not have time to let her come to their house everyday.

Students will not be able to participate in a school's sports team, For example, my cousin Generic_Name attended online class because they moved from her old school to a new school so she decided that she is going to take online class, but in the middle of the she got tired of the online classes so she decided to go back to her new school and she noticed that her new school has a really good soccer team so she decided to try out for it and so she tried out and she got in varsity and she got scholarship for college and she became a soccer player. Some people will say that "Students could play soccer with their friends without attending a school", I believe that students will not get the motivation that the get from a school's sports team, and they cant not get a scholarship.

In conclusion, it is important for students to attend a school so they can socialize with people and their friends, and when they grow up they can tell their kids about their HighSchool years and how they had fun and what they learned from their past, and it will defiantly affect their future by them socializing with people and being able to make conversation with their friends and their family, so I believe that students should attend school because school can help students with many things like: being friendly, being active, and it gets students away from their devices for at least 6-7 hours.
