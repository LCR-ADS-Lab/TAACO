It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change.

I agree that the first impressions are the ones that are impossible to change, because impressions from other person can make you feel proud for that person, and impressions from other people about you can just make you feel good and happy for what you are doing, for your hard work.

Reason of why the first impressions are impossible to change, is when you find those negative and envy people, that does not want you to be successful in life, and when the time came at your favor and you start to begin success in life, there is when you start to see those good impressions from those negative and envy people, and that just can make you feel happy and proud for the hard work that you did, that is why is almost impossible to change those impressions, because not matter what you showed them you always looked forward, but still don't hate them, love them as God loves everyone in this world.

No matter what give good impressions and show them, let them know that they are working hard, people who works hard deserve good impressions, make them feel proud for what they are doing, and also no matter what give good impressions, show people how hard worker, how positive, how respectful person you are, show them that you always look forward not matter what, so when other people talk bad stuffs about you, your ones does not going to believe or change those good impressions from you, because you already showed them that good impressions you keep with you...
