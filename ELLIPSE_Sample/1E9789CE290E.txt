i think it's a good idea because if a student has a low grade in one of his/her' s subjects, it would lower his/her' s grade even more. so basically, it's a distraction to student with low grades that wants to participate in sports or other activities. i do not participate in school activities because i am not perfect on my grades to be honest. it will distract me and it may be the only thing i will think about other than my grades and focusing on my education which can really hurt my chances to be in a very good college. i am not the "sporty" type of person but i have friends that could not make it in their sports activities because of their grades. i would be disappointed for them but yet they have time to bring their grades up to make it up. i also have friends that have an A+ on their grades and are enjoying their sports activities such as basketball, soccer, volleyball, and also softball. i would be glad if you changed the school policy.
