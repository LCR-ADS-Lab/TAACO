Dear TEACHER_NAME

I think that we don't need community service hours because, some students do well in school and they don't get to go to all the 8th grade fun activities that they have by the end of the school year. Like a lot of students do very well in school but they cant go to the fun activities or graduate from 8th grade because they don't have community service hours. If students have bad grades and they have a green sheet that you are failing 8th grade and they have to get 5 and up grades and they are showing progress then i think that its fair to let the students graduate from middle school even do they didn't do service hours. That's why i say that its fair too let the students graduate from middle school even do they didn't do service hours. i know that theirs a lot of students that haven't done the service hours and they are really worried that their parents may get mad at them for not graduating 8th grade. So that's why i' m saying that that's why we don't really need service hours.
