should music, drama and art classes be a requirement. no they should be a elective classes because elective are easier to take and pass. Some students aren't good at taking music , drama and arts classes. Some students dont want to take classes that is required to them.

Elective classes are really easy. Students will have less stress about worrying that they will fail to meet the requirement to pass their school. when the class become an elective class there will be less home work this will allow students to get an easy credit to pass the class. if this was an requirement class it would be more hard and if the students don't pass the class they will have to repeat it.

Students that are not good at music, drama and art will try their best to pass. but if they fail that means they have to do it over again until they pass it. But as an elective class student don't have to be good in it to pass. But even so the student don't like the classes but they still try to go for the free extra credit.

Requirement classes is a class that students have to take in order to graduate but most of the of the student don't want to take it. Elective classes are suitable for those students because the student that did not want to take it can switch to another class that they are good at. Student that did not want to take the requirement class will skip and don't care about it. Elective class are the best they are not hard as an requirement. Requirement class is all about passing but elective classes are fun learning and less stress to put on for the student.

Requirement classes are hard and not fun at all. Electve class are more fun and easier for the student. thats why music, drama and art should be elective classes.
