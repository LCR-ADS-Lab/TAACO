People should make their own decisions because they know what they want. when people make their decision they can do what they wanted to do. when people are seeking guidance they wont have the opportunity as same as people who are alone.

Reason 1, The people who are alone they can research what they want. They can take the classes that they want. They can learn a lot if they take their favorite classes.

Reason 2, When people make their own decisions they might have a good life. People will be happy because they are a teacher. When the people study what they want you might see them happy in school.

Reason 3, The person who might work with a guidance wont have the same fun thing that is happening with the person alone. When the person is with a guidance might not work as hard as the person without the adult. So when a person wants to do the thing he wants make him dont force him to do something else.

In conclusion, people might say when the person is alone and not with a guidance he/she might do something bad and wants to do bad stuff. Well i think if that happens then the adult can do something about but not force them to do it.
