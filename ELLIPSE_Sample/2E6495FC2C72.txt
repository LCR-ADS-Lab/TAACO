Ralph Waldo Emerson

"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment." I agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because each person is a world and we have to do our things separate and does how we learnd about life doing our on things life is not easy as how we thing when we are with our parent's but you have to be older not young so we can decide to do our own things.

We have to work for what we want nothing in this life is easy, All the people need to take a decision in life but firts we need to go to school and then graduated and look for a job and like that we are going to know more about life and make decision and kowing more about life but we always need the endorsement of our parent's.
