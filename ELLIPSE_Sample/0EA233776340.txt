Scientist Albert Einstein said once, " Imagination is more important than knowledge". I agree with his statement , because we would never be there where we are now without it. Three examples for my statement are our technology, communication, and an author.

First example is technology. We've never had technology since the beginning. We needed our imagination first to make it possible, because in the past they would've never thought we going to have smart phones, cars, internet, or that we can even fly. They probably laughed at you when you said something about flying, because it was impossible for them. But now we can, because we have air planes. Our imagination can make almost everything possible.

Next example is our communication. Everyone communicates from animals and humans to nature. They all have a language, so they can understand each other like we speak English, German, Spanish, etc. But before that we needed to made up a language with our imagination. That's why it is so important,because we would've never had the knowledge we have right now without our imagination.

Last example is an author. Authors can write books about everything they want. One good way how to write a book is with their imagination. That is the most important thing they need for writing a book. That is where an author gets his money for when his book is a success. And without imagination there is no author and without no author we wouldn't be there where we are now.

In conclusion I agree with Albert Einstein's statement " Imagination is more important than knowledge." Three examples why I agree with him is without it we would not have technology like we have right now, we could never communicate as good as we do in the present, and an Author we be nothing without imagination.
