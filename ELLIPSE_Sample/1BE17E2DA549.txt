The qualties that make person individual or unique is, to not make any difference between society.

Be sure that you're working in the right path all by your self, and be greatfull, powerfull, be honest, not making any bad disesion not making any problem for society, and last but not least, have a strong felling of wanting to have something or wishing for something to happen.

If you have strong belife in god or in the doctrines of a rilegon, you'll be successfull in your life because it's him that give you all those idea and knowledge, that you can write an essay something like this.

So you just have to be faithfull, and trust him, that's the only way that he can help you and then be an accomplishment.

Something that has been successfully, it's beacuse of you pushed your self you put all effrot and work on you, and that's all beacuse of one goal and that is a great accomplishment.

We have to follow those poeple who were successed in their life of time, we have to see what they did to their society, what honor they had/have for us to read and follow the path they followed.

I think that's another way to be successed.

I'm compeletly agree with this statement that says ''To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.''

Because if you have those kind of seccessfull people in your society then you will have better society, better world and better education for the future.
