It is really great idea to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. The benfet of it ,saving time,money. Also you do not have to go stritets to college you can take a break for a litel bed or you can work and save some money for the college so when you start going to college it will be easeir for you to focs in your stude not work and study in the same time. Also in this year you can breber for college and know what college is about.

saving time it's good idea for everyone all of us some time we need extra time to do somthing but we dont have it. Becase that when high school students graduate early, they will have time to do alot of thing like Work and save money ,Study, work out, travel, learn about something you intreist it to, there are alot of thing you can do.

saving money, a lot of pepole strageal with that when high school students graduate in four years. they will not have time like high school students graduate early, they will work and study in the same time. so they most of them will be tierd and not going to focs in their college, but when high school students graduate early they will have time to work and save money and study with out too much rich.

So i am with high school students graduate early. like i said you can use the time and do somthing going to help you on the futcher. it good idea to students graduate early.
