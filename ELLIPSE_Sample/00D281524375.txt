Technology allows people to do many things such as order things online, play games, and contact other people in a faster way, and if your family members live far away they be able to contact them.

I belive that it has a positive effect because everybody needs to stay in contact with there family that lives far away, and be able to order online is a real help because if people oder there grocerys online thenthey want have to wait in the long lines at the store to checkout intead of waiting they can also get more items that the store dont have the food or items people.

Others may aruge that techbology is a negative out come because lots of people let it take over there lives and act like they cant go anywhere without it and lots of people try to be on there technology when there driving which is a bad thing to do because they will end up getting into a accident. And if the older generations won't know how to use the technology.

In conclusion, having technology is a postive thing because it helps lots of people out and it makes getting thngs done way faster.
