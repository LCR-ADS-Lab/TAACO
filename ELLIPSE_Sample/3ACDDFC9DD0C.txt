Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. In my opinion, i think that it is good idea to permit or allow cell phones during classes' period.

First of all, it is easier to search information. It became to help to students and teachers too, because, it is easier for students to search different information form different topics or classes. Also, the teachers can send information or assignment to the students and they can check it at the moment.

Consequently, they can save time. They can use many tools that help to do easy the work. use the Google translate it is one of the tools more important for some students that the English is their second language, because, it is fast to search the wolds on it.

Third reason, it is useful manage a different social media to be informed in some areas. The students can share information about the different programs, event or sports game that they have in the school. furthermore, it is a manner to keep them involved in the different events at that schools.

Finally, i think the schools should permit or allow cells phone to the students during the classes' period because, it is easier to search information, they can save time to find the new worlds using the Google translate, and manage social media to be informed in some areas.
