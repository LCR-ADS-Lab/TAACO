Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home. I personally think it's a bad idea because you won't get that much help, do stuff individual, and won't be the same as attending school.

If students wants to attend classes from home. Well I recommend not to because you wont get any help from the teachers. yes,

you can call and do a video conferencing but it just wont be the same. For example, there was this one time that i was sick for a week because of the flu. So I emailed my teacher what I miss and her respond is to look it up on teams. Like how am I suppose to know what to do. And she wasn't any help at all. That's why its a bad idea to not attend at school.

Another reasaon why I think it's a bad idea to attend classes from home is that we do stuff individual. At school we have the option to work in a group with people to do our work sometimes. For example, lets say that the teacher let you work in groups. And you're in a group of four. Well some of us dont have to do everything. That's we have to do a little to cooraporate with the group. Meaning you don't have to do the work by yourself. That's why it's a bad idea to stay at home and do work by yorself.

The last reason why I think it's a bad idea is beacuse it won't be the same as attending school. You could also stay in a club or do sports. School is the best way of learning new things and socialize with people. They also havve soccer games and dances that you can go to. Plus you can get some good food from the cafeteria. That's why they should attend school.

In conclusion, I think it's a bad idea to attend classes from home. By staying at home you won't get stuff done. Won't even have frinds to talk too and maybe not understanding some work.
