Dear Principle,

The kids should choose weather they want to have community service or another subject. First, they could help the teachers by helping out with the grades, help other kids out with there assignment, and by cleaning out the mess that other kids done. Next, they can go help out in the homeless shelters, by giving them food, clean up of what they ate, and help out the janitor clean out the trash that's on the ground. Finally, they can also go help out old people home, they can go give them a bath, help them out with there stuff, and help them if they forgot to take there medicine.

First, the kids can help out the teaches. They can help them by, helping them correct grades. They can redo their corrections that the other kids missed or that they accidentally wrote the wrong words or numbers. They help out about the mess the other kids did. They can clean out the papers that were on the ground.

Sincerely,
