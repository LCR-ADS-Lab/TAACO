Something I would like to accomplish in my future is graduate top class in a law school in New York. I always wanted to be a lawyer and this is just one long and important step to my life plan. I want to graduate top class because it helps a lot when I apply for a job because I would be of good use with all the important things I would have learned. If I graduate and I have low marks no law firm is going to want to hire me. My law school has to be in New York because I hear thats where I can get the best education. I Also want to be near family because most of my family already lives there and I could live with them during my collage years or until I get a job so I can afford my own apartment. This is one of my Maine goals something that i know would make my life better and easier for when I get older so that is what I'm set out to do that is what i want to accomplish.
