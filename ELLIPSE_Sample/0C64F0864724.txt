I think that knowledge is more important cause u have learned things from people and it stays in your head. The good thing is it stays in your head. You can remember a lot of stuff. But imaginating is also good cause u think of stuff with your imagination. Most of the time knowledge is good sometimes its just that you forget.

imaginating is not that good it just help you to think about stuff and like make creations. It's just like legos you need your imagination more cause u are building and thinking of stuff. Imagination is good in some occasions cause u need it for other stuff. But with knowledge you store information you need. Which helps cause you can fit a lot of info in your knowledge.

With knowledge it's all about the important stuff cause you need it. You can share information too but you can earn it.

You can learn so many things around the world and remember some of it. Knowledge is also apart of learning cause thats how u store the information through knowledge. It's good to learn about stuff but imagination is just you thinking of something but probably not happening. In knowledge you have the power that succeeds you in life.
