Be yourself.

Don't let anyone tell you different, know who you are, never doubt yourself.

I agree with Ralph Waldo. Because people are willing to discharge you with their native mindset.

In my opinion being confident always be the best in life. People can say what they like all day long. But you are the only 1 who know where you headed with your life. in the society that we are living in today, is complicated so you have to be you. however you need to be strong in other to do it.

If you unsdernding exactly who you are. Then you don't have to care at all, because you are bold. Whatever they are saying will be just wast of time to you. it's so important to be awed of who you are. Never worry about them just shine like a domino. That is the king of person you should be.

If you are doubting yourself, the others will get opuntunty to ruined your life more. But if you said no, is no,that mean you will keep putting hard, and harder. that will pull them closer to you, and they will start doing same think. Be brave and honest with yourself. you can be anything, or do a wonderful stuff in live time. You can take advise from people, although you know what you are going to do already.

When you are so nice people will try to show you how they though things should be, but if you believe in who you there will be a big different forever.
