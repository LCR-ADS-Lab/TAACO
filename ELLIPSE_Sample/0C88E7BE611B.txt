In this world its hard to be yourself everyone wants to do the same thing . Still being yourself in this world is the greatest accomplishment . A lot of people judge in this world telling people whats good and whats bad for this its hard to be yourself in a world like this . People with social media will change people and being in high school with people around you will judge and follow the trend of the world.

Social media is like a book of rules everyone wants to follow and act the same . Popular apps like instagram people post things about their life and how they're doing good and looking great with a trending outfit . People see this post and do the same thing and act different knowing that this is not you . For this you want to follow and do the same thing and change your way of living and yourself .

Being yourself in high school is a accomplishment , someone will always judge and make you feel down . For this people change their personality and there way of life .like me I was scared to talk to new people because i thought they will make fun of me but that was not true and for that I am always acting like my self .Its the way of high school and if you beat the judgment and still be yourself its a accomplishment in life .

In conclusion being yourself in this world that is constantly trying to change you is a accomplishment . A lot people change because of social media and high school. I agree its accomplishment because you beat the judgment and the fear of not being yourself in this world .
