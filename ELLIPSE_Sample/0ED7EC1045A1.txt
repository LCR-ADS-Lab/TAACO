One person,that shared wisdom with me was my dad. My dad is 46yrs old,and he likes to tell me and my siblings stories about him when he was a kid. One story he told me was,when he got a nail stuck in his foot. the scar of the nail is still there, and its not a pretty good one.

I think it's good to learn the experience of others because,it makes you smarter,for example,when you go to school,the teacher have enough enough experience on the subject he/she teaches,so they can share with you some of the experience they had on the subject.

another reason why i think its good to share experience with others is,it makes u wanna do more of the thing you are being taught,for example,i learned how to ride a bike by my friend who has been riding it for almost 3yrs,so he had experience on riding a bike.

So i think it is very important to learn from the experience of others.
