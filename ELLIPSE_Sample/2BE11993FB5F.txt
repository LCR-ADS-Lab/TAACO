It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I personally disagree with this statement because, many times i have been told that i have a bad first impression the first time people see me, many people say i look mean and with a bad attitude. However, i do not have an attitude when people are friendly or speak me.

New research says that it is far easier to loose a good reputation, then to gain one. Which is true, but you would never know how is the other person until you speak to them. You cannot judge a person by the way they look, speak or drees. For example, couple of years back on my first day of school, in the United States, people would judge me because, they thought i knew English, and when they would speak to me, i would put my head down and not say anything, months later i learned english and knew how to have a conversation with them; Not long a long, i had a person come to me and say; I did not thnk you spoke english, because i remember back in 6th grade, you would not talk. He changed the way he thought of me when i started having a conversatiomn with him. Perphas, You can always change you first impression.

First impressions are clearly not the best ones, but we can always make a choice on wheather change them or not. I have experienced many first impressions. However, i have always told myself that my reputation does not depends on how others see or think of me, depends on how i see myself. Only ourselves have the choice to change our first impression.
