They said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, I disagree with that. I believe it's possible to change your first impression. First impressions are almost always: wrong, judgmental, or they are assumptions.

I'd like to say that I, Generic_Name, have had first impression on classmates, teachers, and strangers. They usually end up being wrong about that person, and end up being a totally different person than expected.

First impressions are 80 percent always judgmental. They judge the person by what they wear, by what they look like, and by the way they act. I for example was non for being a trouble maker in middle school and when I started my freshman year of high school, I was non as a quiet kid for a while. Reason being is because i was too nerves sent it was my first year in a much bigger school. After a while, my classmates started to get to know me a bit more and realized how much of a troublemaker I was.

Whenever I saw a new need student in the schools that i have gone to, I would always assume by the way they dressed, looked and acted. This year there was a girl, lets call her Generic_Name. Generic_Name would wear hunting clothing, had glasses and looked funny.

One day I made fun of her and she went off on me. She told me her life story and I felt bad and apologized for what I said. Now I look back to this story and remind myself to try my best to not assume too much about a best.

In conclusion

I stilll believe that first impressions can be changed. You just have to open up and express yourself, telll people your life story like if it were a book.
