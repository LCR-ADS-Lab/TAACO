If your having a good attitude then you're probably in a good mood, for example if u get enough sleep, if u eat a good breakfast or lunch, have a good day then you might have a good attitude. somethings when someone is upset or not feeling good or fine, you or a person dont have to always have a good attitude because people are different some people or mean or nice some people can choose to have a good attitude or not to have a good attitude, Im not feeling good today and so i can choose to not have a good attitude cause today i'm probably gonna have a bad attitude. they might still have a good attitude. But if you have a bad attitude you might not be having a good day. when i'm not having a good day i dont have the best attitude but i work on it. When someone or somebody doesnt have a good attitude you can see it and hear it because their words hit different then what that person usually says when he/she is having a good day. people usually try not to have a bad attitude because they might get into serious trouble by blabbering and having a big mouth. I have my own experience because i have had a bad attitude some what in my life and it didnt go well if u ask me. I think in my ways if someone had a bad attitude they might have been raised like that and if some peoples are having a good attitude then they must have been taught manners but i dont know because everyone is different. People choose to have a good or bad because then it depends on their attitude it depends on what attitude they would have. Today i lost an hour of sleep so i'm probably gonna have bad day unlike others. everyone has different attitudes depends on their day.
