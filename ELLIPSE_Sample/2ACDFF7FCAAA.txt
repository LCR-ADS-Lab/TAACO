Dear,

Principal l think that we should be allowed to bring our phone to school just in cause of emergence. And during class time we should turn them off, when we come out of school we should be able to use them. We never no if threes an emergence some day and we don't have phones and how are we to call our parents .If we didn't have phones how are we saps to contact our parents . that why we should bring phones to school not because we want to text because our safety. That's why some parents get phones for there kid because they know that some day we are going to use it for a very important reason .For we could contact them when some thing is going wrong. For they could be a to know were we are just in cause .and that's why l think we have phones. And that's my reason why we bring phones to school.
