People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters because the people that wants make their own decisions they could not to know anything, just they are following their instincts and ideas so that mean they will believe that what they are doing is correct when it does not and it is against the rules.

Laws; the consumption of drugs and alcohol, to carry of guns, and to drive; the consumption of drugs is unlawful in too many states and you need a permission that you can buy it and the alcohol is legal but you need to be 21 years old or more to buy it, to carry of guns; is legal but is same to drugs and alcohol you need a permission to buy one and be older, and to drive to get a license need to be 16 or older that its up to you, but if you decided to get your license when you are 16 years old, you have to drive with someone also as copilot; the copilot need be more older than you, you need to do this because they want be sure you have the experience to drive alone.

Work; when you have a job you have rules that you need to follow as a schedule, duties; you have a specific schedule that tell you when you have to come to the work and when you have go to home this help to your job keep everything organize to the employers because if the employers come to the work whenever they want to, can this affect the company, like if you are an accountant and the company needs you in the morning but how you make your own decision to do not go in the morning you go in the afternoon, so as you skip your specific schedule the company have a problem with the accounts and its your fault for not follow the schedule, duties well you have specific duties for you by your skills, so that mean you can not make a decision do something also because you can be fire.

Society; well you do not have the decision to do every thing you want outside, like you can not to burn a library because you had the idea brilliant to do it, you can not kick or hit to everyone to see outside just because you have a idea make laugh your friends, and you can not into a private property to get a flower that you see and liked , you can not make that decision in your life

In conclusion, we can not let the people make their own decisions, I am not saying that people can not have rights to do or be something, I am saying that people can not do everything they want, they need guidance from experts and authorities to help them more to the minors they do not have the conscience to know what is right or no.
