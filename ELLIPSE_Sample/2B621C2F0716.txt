Someone who shares wisdom is like talking to an angle.

One person who shares wisdom to me is my friend because, we love each other, we care about each other, and just giving out wisdom, is just nice.

My friend gives me wisdom cause they love me and wish for the best for me. My friend always tells me that I should always go forward and don't look back, to the bad thing and keep on going. If i'm going through some bad stuff with someone or something you just got to stay positive and just not give up on your self.

Friends give out wisdom because it is nice and helpful for people, my friend like to give out advice and say good things and give out wisdom, because they are nice, and are caring friends and just keep there heads forward not back.

My friends give out wisdom because they care about me and for other people to and not for just one person but for multiple people. My friends are just nice and just some good friends to me and to other people out there in that world, because with wisdom you can give advise to people.

I have learned from other people because i have seen people go through it and thats a happy thing because you give out advise to someone you look forward to, like your parents, aunt, uncle, and the people you trust like a close friend to. Anyone that you trust id good because then you can stay positive.

I just think that giving out wisdom is such a kind think to do to people and to friends and family. Wisdom can mean a lot of thing to people, like kindness and being happy and just putting a smile in your face. Wisdom is just a good way to stay positive and be yourself

Wisdom can make you a happy person.
