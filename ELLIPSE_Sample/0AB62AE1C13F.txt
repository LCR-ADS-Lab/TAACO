Having to learn from the experiences of others. It may help you participate in school activities, and learn new information.

My first reason is that you can try new things. If you hear that your friend participated on a school activity, and keeps talking about what they experienced , and you found it interesting. You can try joining a school activity and experience the fun time that they had in the activity.

My last reason is that you can learn new things. If you hear about the math program in school and students kept talking about what they learned and how fun it was. You can get intrested and you will want to join the math program and experience what they experienced you might learn some new informations.

I think it is important to learm from the experience of others. It may help you join a school activity, and learn new information. If you try new things like other people you are not going to regret it, because you are trying new things that will have benefits.
