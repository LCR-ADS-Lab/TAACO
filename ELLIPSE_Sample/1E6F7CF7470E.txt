To help or make the world a better place you only need one thing, your imagination.

Imagine this, a world without people imagining things. if people don't use their imagination then half of the stuff we have now would be not here. I agree that imagination is important than knowledge, because you can imagine how your future going to be, and imagine how you can change the world.

Imagination is important because without it, how did people make the things we have now, because they use there imagination. If you imagine it hard enough it might come true. Scientist are making medicine to cure the sick, why do they do that? Because they imagined that if there was no medicine then half of they human population would die, so they make medicine. If there were no police then our world would be full of criminals and destruction so they imagined to make a police station and people became cops. You can also help out the world. If you just imagine how you are going to do that and imagine how your future is going to be if you do that. I know some of us imagine to grow up and marry a famous person, sadly imagination don't work like that, but there are many beautiful girls and boys (or puppies, if your going to be single all your life) out there. And I know you prefer someone like Emma Watson or someone else, but like I said imagination don't work like that. You can also imagine the impossible and it could happen ( but not the marriage part), if you make it happen. So I believe that imagination is more important than knowledge and I hope now, you do to.
