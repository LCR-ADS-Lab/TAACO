First impressions are almost impossible to change because it's the first image that I give to the others, what other people think about me , people are going to treat me as I treat them the first time and no one is going to change his mind easily

First impressions are important, because thats how the the others around see me, because after the first time that they see me, that is the image that they have about me, and if it is a bad image ,thats how they are going to remember me every time that they see me, even if I am not like that , like if a was having a bad day , and a was grumpy , they are going to think about me as a grumpy person, even if I am a happy person, but that is the image that they are going to have about me.

whats people going to think about me depends on the first impression that I gave them, because if I gave a bad first impression , but then I am trying to be nice with them , they are not gonna believe me, because they are going to still thinking about me as a bad person and they are going to think that I am lying.

After the first impression I am always going to get what I give ,I am going to be treated the same way as I treated others the first time , making more difficult to change their minds about the first impression.

Is important to keep in mind that the others are not going to change their mind easily , but it is not impossible , if a person try really hard and with good intentions , the other person maybe can change his mind about that first impression , but sometimes a person does not have to do anything to change that first impression , someone can change the first impression by his actions , even if is from a bad impression to a good impression or from a good impression to a bad impression, but it is possible.

first impressions are really hard to change because the first image a person gives, what others think about me after it, and they are going to treat me the same way as I did with them , but it si posible to change.
