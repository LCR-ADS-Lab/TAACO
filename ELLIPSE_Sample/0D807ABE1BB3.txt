In a recent survey 70% of pedestrians think imagination is more important than knowledge. One day I imagined that I would play travel soccer for a really good team in Florida when I imagined that I put my mind into it and I made my imagination become reality.

For example when you were a kid you used to imagine that you were flying through the air or in space fighting aliens on Mars, imagination can come a long way from just being a kid to inventing something that can change the world. I agree with Albert Einstein's statement I do believe his statement not only because he was one of the greatest scientist in the world but because this statement is so truthful. Knowledge is a huge part of our lives we need knowledge in everyday activities in school we gain our knowledge by going to class and learning more and more lessons everyday.

Imagination is more important than knowledge, everyone can imagine things it's not whether if I have more knowledge than you or if she has more knowledge than me there is no limit when it comes to imagination. Anyone can imagine something and make it happen it's the effort you put into your imagination that makes knowledge superior to your imagination. Knowledge can only get you so far in life if you don't have a thought proccess but what you do have is knowldge how far is that going to get you whee you need to be?

If we didn't have any imagination in our lives where would we be right now? As a whole what would we do if someone never imagined a car and invented it or if someone never imagined a light bulb and invented it, what would happen if we never have imagined those daily necessity's. Imagination paints the full picture in our lives.
