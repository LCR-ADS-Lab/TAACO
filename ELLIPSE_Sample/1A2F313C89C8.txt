I am a student that have many difficulty with subjects. I think an after school homework club will workout for many students like me. Although,some students are too sacred or shy to stay after. But everyone is different I don't think that students should be scared or shy because they need help in a subject. Most students need help in general some teachers can always ask students to stay after school. If students are failing tests or quizzes teachers can also ask them to stay after. Some units are way to difficult for students and if they only need help in that unit then they can stay after for help in just that unit. After,they get help in that unit teacher can also let them retake the test or quiz they failed but that's optional to the teachers if they can retake it or not.

If students stay after school they can study for upcoming test or quiz. There also will be fun activate for students who don't want to go home. The activates will be subject related. Students can finish homework early. They can also get help in more then one subject. Student can bring their own work that they can work on or need help in it. I think students should be able to get the help that then for uncoming test or quiz.
