We go to the school 5 days a week, school last for about 5 to 6 hours a day. The idea of taking off one day and adding 2 more hours to the school's schelude. Could be a good thing or a bad thing?

Adding 2 more hours to school's schelude would be better for some students, because we could have

3 days off. More time for us to do what we love to do.

We would have a lot more time for ourselve to socus on our hobby but also on education.

This could affect other student on doing homework,

because some students are too busy working or doing other stuff and don't have time. Adding

2 more hours to school time it's going to apply on more homewrok everyday.

Also you could have more time in school to do homework with the help of your teacher, but this would affect people who has to do things everyday after school.

In my opinion school should stay how they are right now, thats my preference, because students should not get out of school too late because some of them have other activities like: sports clubs,

dance, or even part time jobs on tha afternoon.

Eventhough in my opinion school is fine how it is. There are many students who would choose

4 days of school rather than 5 to save some energy and resources but also to have free time for themselves. Do you really thing adding 2 more hours and taking 1 day off saves a lot of energy and resources? i think it doesn't work, because if you add all those 2 hours on those

4 days, it ends up being the same thing, or even a waste.
