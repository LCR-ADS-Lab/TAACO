Duke Ellington said, " A problem is a chance for you to do your best." Do you think a problem is a good way to learn form your mistake? Learning from your mistake is a great way to know, what you did wrong, and how you can fix the problem.

What does he mean by " A problem is a chance for you to do your best."? A problem is a mistake you did, and doing your best is improving form your mistakes. Some people learn from their mistake, and others don't. People who do learn from their mistake can help others and their self.

I do agree that problems is a chance for all of us to do are best. Their some people who don't really care if it happens again. We should all care about our mistakes because if we didn't care our mistakes would happen again , and if that mistake was bad, then you should care.

I made lots of mistake like failing a grade because i didn't care about school , but then i change and stared to be more motivated and now that helps me work hard to get my dream job. One of my other mistake is my anger. I would always get angry but I always try to clam down because I would always take it out on people, but it won't hurt to try to learn form your mistakes.

Everyone can learn from their mistakes and it won't hurt to try. The benefits is knowing what to do when the mistakes happens again. Like what Duke Ellington once said, "A problem is a chance for you to do your best."
