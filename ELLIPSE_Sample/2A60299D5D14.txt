I agree with honesty because it can end so many problems. So they don't have to build up and cause a lot of damage. Another reason why i agree is that you don't have to lie even more to cover what you already lied about. And it its hard to catch up with Ur lying it can also get confusing and you can get caught lying to there face. The last thing is if you get caught lying it can cause more problems with the person and can lead to more issues. It can also help the other person to trust you. If the person trust you you dont have to lie to them so it wont hurt there feeling. Also you can lose someone trust or lose the realashinship you have with them. It can also hurt a lot of other people that u care about. lying can cause you to look bad in front of people. And id it hurts there feeling you can solve them because you told the truth.

Also it can help you to stop lying and get better at telling the truth so everyone can trust you. and thats the reason why i think honesty id the best policy
