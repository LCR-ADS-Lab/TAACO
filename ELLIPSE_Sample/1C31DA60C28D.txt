It has been said the first impressions are almost impossible to change? It is possible for a human to forget his/her first impression because all human forget. we easily forget small simple things for example people can just do stuff and later on in the day and forget about it easy. Many people can't remember there first childhood friend so am against that first impressions are impossible to change it is possible to change. Am against it myself I forget everybody forgets things but not all of us do but a lot does.

Sometimes we purchase things and forget that we did tell we see the package in our doors or mail box then we gonna realize that we purchase something and forget about it. Is the same way how you can forget about your first impression. I myself can't tell who was my childhood best friend or my first dogs name. a lot of us don't know when we got married with our wife or husbands a lot of us don't even know some of our grandparents names is lot if things that we easily forget in life so easily.

Am against it because i so it my self people forget easily a lot and there will be no human who will stand and say i don't forget or i know everything in life all what i have learn since my childhood life i can still say it and tell you all about it that is not possible. A lot can say stuff like that will not be able to do or say about it. There is no way that you can remember your first impressions there is no way. a lot maid think they still remember it but they don't your mind gives you that like i can remember my first impressions then you think about it you can't ravel it. So no to that
