I don't believe school should follow in businesses footsteps and do the four-day school week. I believe that school should stick with the five-day school week. Because it would be better for the students in the long run.

If school keep the five-day school week there would be a lot of benefits with that. like if students have five-day school week there would be so much free time for students to do whatever they want like take care of responsibility, after school clubs, homework, study. And free time is way more useful to students.

Now some can argue saying that if school had four-day school week they would have more time because they would have a extra day off of school. And that true but there a catch with that it only one extra day off like say if you were in a club and you meet on Thursday then you would have to show up to the club later because school was longer now of course i'm using that as an example. So if school did have the four-day school week then yes you would have a extra day but like I said before there would be a catch to it.

Now even i'm not going to lie and say that five-day school week is the greatest thing they have there. They do have there down fall. Like for starter we have five days where we have to show up to school. And also school is long on enough with the five-day school week. So yea... five-day school week do suck too.

In conclusion, I believe that school should keep five-day school week and not the four-day school week. As I believe that it is better for students in the long run.
