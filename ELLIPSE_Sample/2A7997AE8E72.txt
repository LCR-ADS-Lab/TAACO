A first impression is almost impossible to change? I agree with this statement because what i think a first impression is that it's your first time presenting yourself to people for the first time. Those people who you are present yourself too, are getting to know you for the first time. It is very important for example, applying for a job can show the interviewer you can get hired based on first impressions and also it can be for making friends too. In English 10 I did a interview and when it was time for me to go and get interviewed i had to shake the persons hand and said good morning. During the interview the person was asking me question and I answered the questions politely and after the interview i got a grade for it. The first impression are very important in an interview because they are the things you are going to get hired for in a job interview. My experience with the interview went really well and now i know that if i ever apply for a job i got to be good enough to get hired.
