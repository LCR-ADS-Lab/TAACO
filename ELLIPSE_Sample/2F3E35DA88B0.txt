h y schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones for educational purposes? Although some say that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes, actually they shouldn't because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media and also students probably will try to use their cell phones to cheat.

Those who believe that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purpose they have their reasons. They believe that it will be more easy for students to complete assignments and also it will help students to turn in their work on time.

In my opinion I think that schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purposes because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media. I think that because when I am in my Algebra 2 class my teacher always assign us to complete some work that we have in blackboard,but what I noticed in the last month was that most of my classmates that were around me they weren't doing the assignment instead some of them were just playing video games,watching videos in YouTube and using Snapchat.

I think that schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose because students may use the cell phones to cheat. I believe that because such as a student if I was taking a test and I didn't study and I have the cell phone with me I will try to use it to find some answers in Google and also if students are allow to use the cell phones in the class they may use them to cheat by taking pictures of other student study guide,assignments and homework.

In conclusion schools shouldn't allow students to have and use cell phones for educational purpose because they will spend most of the time in social media and also they may use the cell phones for cheat.
