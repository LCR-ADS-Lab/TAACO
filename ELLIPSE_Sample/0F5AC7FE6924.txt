What I think is that our character can sometimes be formed and controled by the influences we learnd and the influences people tell us because there is a lot of people that tells you new things and sometimes those things are bad influences but sometimes we can contorl our character and no body can tell you bad influences because you dont care and you dont listen to those ho tell us bad influences. Influencs can demage your life with influences you learn bad things and you are not learning any good.

How can influences affect you, influences can make you not control your own character they can lead you to bad things and they make you do things you dont want to do they can also get addicted to somethings like drugs is you listen other influences from someone that do drugs or drink alcohol.

People would do better is they dont listen to those bad influences that people tell us and they can learn better from the good things they hear and do thats why you should never listen to those bad influences people tell you. You should only hear and do good things that will give a better future.

If you want to control your own character you dont have to listen to other people influences you dont have to do what people tells you to do because you need to be your self and solve your own problems.

Our character is what our mids control so there is no need for other people to tell you what things you should do or your decicions you make you need to do those things by your self not with other people telling you what to do.

People shouldnt get in other people problem they should solve their own problems and they should let other people solve their own problems and control their own character.
