Everyone own create their goals ,would positive attitude be the key to be the part important in their life? In my opinion

I agree everyone have attitude positive, for nobody low their self-esteem , and sure the things do , because in your life I know you have someday attitude negative,but is where the people like you feel bad and you feel with the things say about you and don't leave the people hurt .For example some people say things bad about you and you don't put attention just leave talking, is good because you know how you are and that don't important what say the other people. You need have plans for you life, and don't leave that other people ruin your goals. Don't leave that nobody low your self-esteem you need feel good with yourself. When you do something and believe is good. On your work , or your school leave you a work to do you don't need check other person because sometimes the person say is bad your work maybe for copy your ideas or because the he work is wrong is good you have you attitude positive for believe in your abilities and believe in you. In conclusion you need attittude positive always and believe in yourself.
