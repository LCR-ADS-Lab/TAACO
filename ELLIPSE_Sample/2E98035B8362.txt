American jazz legend Duke Ellington said, "A problem is a chance for you to do your best. "

I agree, because when a problem is present you have a chance to learn a lesson, new things and methods to solve it.

When a problem is present you have an opportunity to learn a lesson and keep trying to solve the problem until you find the answer to it.

When you have a problem you can also learn new things like what is it that is making the problem, what it is affecting, and whom is it affecting.

When you have a certain problem you can also learn other methods to solve it like how and who made the problem, how can you solve the problem, and what plan you can use to solve it.

For example you are facing a bigger problem that you have ever faced before and when you finale solve it you have learned a new lesson, method, and two or more new thing about how you can,may or will solve your future problems even if they are tougher than the ones you ever faced before because the bigger you get, the bigger your problems become.

For another example, imagine yourself as a detective in a homicide case, you are facing the problem of learning new evidence and using new methods, while using the lessons and new thing you have learned while were investigating the crime scene. You have to use all of those tactics to find the corporate, because all you need is to use the lessons you have learned while you are learning a new one, learning two or more new things, and having a method to capture the corporate (criminal).

And that is why i agree that a problem is a chance for you to do your best.
