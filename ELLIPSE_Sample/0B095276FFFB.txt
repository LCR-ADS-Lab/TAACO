MORE SCHOOL TIME MORE LEARNING TIME!!

The school board wants to add one hour and a half to school each day.

And I do think it would be a good idea because kids would have more time to learn, They wont have to stay after school as much and the teacher can even have more time to finish a lesson and have time to learn new things.

First reason I think adding time to school is a good idea is because when they add more time the kids will have more time to learn. Also have some free time ones in a while but get a lot of work done.

Second reason I think it would be a good idea is because... They wont have to stay after school as much because they would be Abel to do some of their work or homework in a class they might have extra time in or even in a class where they don't do anything so like a free time class. And they wont have to do it at home or say they forgot it or forgot to do it.

And my least reason that I think that it's a good idea is that it even bean fits the teachers so they can finish a lesson faster. Also get a unit done and get pass the boring stuff and have time for the fun stuff. And they don't have to stress about not getting a lesson done because now they will have time to at least get close to finishing one.

Those are some of the reason why I agree with and time to school hours and we can all have more learning time and won't have to stress as much about school anymore.
