First impression are very important when you first meet someone. Many people say first impressions are almost impossible to change, but i strongly disagree with that. Majority of the time when we meet someone we already think of them in a certain way, but our judgment could always be wrong. Thats why i believe first impressions could always change.

I believe that first impressions can change the way people think of you. Sometimes people can be irritable or just in a really bad mood because something is occurring in their lives, but in reality that's not how they really are. One reason first impressions can be wrong, is because maybe they didn't get enough sleep at night, and they have to get up early to go to work, or school in the morning. For example, i am not much of a morning person, so when i wake up in the mornings i can be rude, and people might not want to talk to me, but if you see me later in the afternoon i will be smiling, and laughing. Another reason first impressions could be wrong, is because they might not feel comfortable with the people who they are surrounded by, and be very shy, but once you start talking to them they change. For example, my best friend and i used to hate each other. I used to think she was annoying, and rude, and i am guessing she thought the same for me. One day we both started to talk to each other, and i found out we have many things in common, and that we are like the same people. That same day we became the best of friends, now we are basically like sisters. This is why i think that first impressions can always change.

In conclusion, i believe that from now on as we move forwards in life we shouldn't assume what the other person is like, and not to always rely on first impressions because they could always be wrong.
