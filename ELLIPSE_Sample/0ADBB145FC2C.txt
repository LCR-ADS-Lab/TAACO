i disagree because some people dont like to do activities at school and they rather go home because some activities at school are boring and the people like to stay after are the ones with more active system and they like to stay for sports or learn more. people would like to see how fun it could be sometimes because staying after is not that bad you can stay at your favorite club and activity mines will be to pla y for soccer club and they could see how much fun it could some people would stay for other classes and be interested so they can bring there grades up and get goods grades on there report card. and some others will go to like a club or a technology room because they think it interesting the principal maybe wanted students to do something fun and not be bored at home the principal probably wants them to be a fun person for a day and give everybody a chance to join a club or activity and have fun and so they can meet other people and know about them so they wont be always talking to the same people sometimes people need to know other people so they can talk about each other and talk about how much they love the activities but in my opinion i want to disagree in the same time because some people dont like to stay after school because its boring and theres nothing fun to do so they just go home some people are just tired and exhausted and thats why some othere people cant even stay just to help there parents around the house or take care of there brother or sister but sometimes you just get bored and dont even want to stay at the school because they are tired of seeing the classes and the people or just even learning sometimes be like i want to stay but they never stay they just and other says i will stay this time and they dont stay but some people just dont like to see the school everyday they only come to learn and leave home but other people come and stay because they have nothing to do or they just bored in the house. so they just go to the after school activity so they wont be bored so they can just have fun.
