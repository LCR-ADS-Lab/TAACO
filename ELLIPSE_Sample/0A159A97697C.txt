We should not change are school lunch menu to a new,healthier lunch menu. If we change the school lunch menu then that will eliminate some of the students' favorite cafeteria food. It would be more expensive if we switch over to a more healthier menu. Many students' will stop eating school lunch every day .

Moving to a more healthier menu will eliminate students' favorite. student favorite are pizza sticks,ham burger,and pop corn chicken which would be eliminate. A lot of kids' do not like to eat healthy then rather have junk food.

Heath food is way more expense then junk food so switching it would be a lot more expense. which means more tax because we are going need more money to get Heather oppsisd. Some student would like it and just throw it away. So it would just be a wast of money.

For some student the food they get at school is the only food they get all day so if we switch we got to think about those kids. Are they going get full off they mean are they going like it. students will be more lickly to pick a junk food over a sale or furit.

but mf we dont change are school lunch menu to a more healthier opp side it is just going be bad for are student health. Some of the school lunch mean have around half of carols we should be having a day. We should want the best health for are students that why we should change are menu to a more Heather one.

With all this said principal i think u should not change are menu for lunch.
