I think that students shouldn't follow this program of graduating in three years but then again, some students would rather want to graduate in the traditional four years. The reason why I don't think this is such a good idea is because if students follow this program, they're going to have to take classes in the summer and they're probably not going to take elective courses and most students would be frustrated about this since students like elective courses and don't want to spend their summer taking classes when they could be busy like working on a summer job or spending time with their families on vacations. Another reason why I don't think this is a good idea is because most students just want a normal high school experience and would rather take normal classes and just graduate in four years.

High school isn't that bad, it just requires a lot of hard work and most students are not motivated enough to try in school so students should just stay in school and try their hardest instead of being unmotivated. My personal thought on this topic is that there's not really a difference of graduating either in three or four years since both the programs and high school require a lot of work so students probably think that these programs are going to be easier when really it's the same as high school but worse because as I stated before, students would have to take classes in the summer and no one wants to do that so there's another reason why students should just stay in high school and graduate the year they're supposed to graduate. So these are my reasons and thoughts on why students shouldn't follow this program and should stay in high school and thank you for your time.
