The reasons why I think people should make their own decision. it's because we shoud think about our own decision and decide if it good or wrong. It's better to follow your thoughts and not other thoughts. It help's you because you can express yourself on how you feel.

First people should make their own decision because you are capable enough to think about your them. Second you should know what's right and what its not right, what shouldn't do and what you should do and decide if its right. Third follow your mindset because if you do other's decision, you are deciding in other's people mindset. Others don't feel what you feel, they have different mindsets, opinions and ideas. No matter what, follow your ideas and decisions. People gonna talk about you no matter how well or wrong you're deciding.

I hope people do what they feel and not what other's make them feel. If you ever have a problem ask people you trust, like an opinion and listen what they have to say about it. Then you should analize and think about it and decide what ideas you should use but in your own way. Use it to find a way to resolve anything you are dealing with. Thats why i think people should not listen to others, why not following your thought?.
