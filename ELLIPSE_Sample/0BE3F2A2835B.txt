I am agree with the idea about individuality and from my point of view this is the one of the best way to be yourself and nobody can not tell you what you have to do in your life, but at the same time you need to do everything well or try to do your best because your actions can affect others persons, in life you will gonna get what you give to others, for example if you are a good person, people will gonna be good with you but if you are rude , life is gonna be rude with you too, one of the biggest problem in life now is the changes of the gender, just because a boy likes other boy he is doing something inopportune, inhuman, no I do not think so, I think that is not important he is not guilty to feel what he is feel he not star feeling those things because he want .

It's not important if you are rich or not , everyone are the same not because what you have some "importants opportunities" on your life , you are more than others , If you are a indivual person that means that you do not have to be what others people wants , you are what you want, nobody has to tell you : Show me! what you can do or who you are , you just are what you want or can keep tryin and doing your best.

In life so many people will be rude with you or disagree with you on your personal bussines but there is where you need to be original as be yourself; Other example can be that you need to be positive in life if you get in a problem that you think you don be free easy just keep thinking in the positive way, people can tell you what they want to you but they do not know if that is what you want.

Also I have to say that your family is somenthing important in this case, because they teach you how to be in "real life", so your famlily have to let you know how to be , how to act, in what believe for example they can tell you if you have to care what people say about you or your life, if you need you to have a individual life or no, in facts that is big point that you have know .
