Most of us always have issues choosing between working with a group or working alone. However, both systems has lows and highs. "walk alone and you will get faster, walk in group and you will get farther" a simple quot that my 8th grade teacher used to tell me back then. Having said that, I believe working with a group brings many more benefits than working alone.

First of all, working alone keeps you rejected from other groups, which makes you think nobody wants to work or interact with you, by contrast, working with a group helps giving you security to spread out all thoughts you keep in mind, knowing that the rest of the group will do the same and together will even fix or improve ways and ideas to obtain an amazing work or result. Moreover, it is a gain to your mental health interact with others.

Secondly, working with a group has benefits such as: learning something new, less work, less time, more facts and others. while you working with a group you will always learn something new from others, that will support similar ideas and make it more specific, to put in another way. "two heads are better than one". what's more, it helps your self stem and support the way you talk in public.

I used to be the one who loves to work alone, then I realized that, "Working in group brings many more benefits than working alone". in my opinion, working with a group is more beneficial in many ways, always having in count the people you are surrounded by are wise people.
