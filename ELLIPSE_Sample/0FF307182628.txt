Dear principal,_x000D_

I think that it is okay for students to bring cell phones to school . But there cell phones need to be turned off during class . They could use them during passing periods and lunch time but not during class time . What if they need their phones for emergencies or what if their parents want to know where they are after school. Parents some times want to know where their kids are so that is why we need to bring cell phones to school . That is if some kids have cell phones because not all the kids have cell phones . We will promise not to use the cell phones during class times . And the teachers can see if they are turned off o not . And that is all i want to say._x000D_
