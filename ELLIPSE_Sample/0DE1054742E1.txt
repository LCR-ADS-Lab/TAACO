School board supervisor do you want student to get bad grades during the Sol If not.?

these are three reason why Adding one an a half hours to school each day can hurt students.

students need brain break student can get tired.

student can get in trouble by their parents.

first we all know that students need brain break. Working to much can hurt student in there academic work.

study have shown that 60% of schools in the county have had bad grades in there sol from not sleeping well.

Student can get tired easily. If the school board supervisor adds one and half hours each day during schools, then students have to wake up early. We know that in a normal school day we have eight hours of school and 11 hours of sleep, if the school supervisor adds one an a half hours extra to a normal school day then we would go at 6am to school, Some student would not like that, Because they wouldn have a fresh day and they would be grumpy all the time. And that also can affect there school grades to.

furthermore, student can get in trouble by their parents, because some student do after school activity and the student can be really tired, Parents might even get angry because the student are not doing there chores.

In conclusion I disagree with the question because having to extend the school day, Can hurt everyone in the school. And can also get some teacher fire because the student are not learning well and are not doing their academic work.

Please dont extend our school day!!!!
