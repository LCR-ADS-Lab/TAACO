"Failure when your start and success when you done" This sentence is my prompt. To day I have read the prompt of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. He said "success consists of going from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm". I agree with him. Because the mean of he prompt is similar of my prompt. I believe people can't success without failure.

Longtime ago when i was 5 year old I can remember on the nice day of Thailand. I walk on the way front of my house. I look around and see my bike in the glad. I took the bike and ride. I still can't drive my bike yet and I will practice and my parent teach me how to drive the bike. I practice almost 2 hour and still can't drive. I give up and try again tomorrow. At tomorrow during the morning I have to practice again and I still can't drive. I am so wonder and say to my self

"why I can't drive the bike". Then my grandmother sit down on the chair and look at me. She said why you don't balance you weight of both side. That is answer of my question. I am try to make balance my weight and finally I can drive the bike.

The rule of this world is input always same output. The anything you get is come from anything you pay.

When you do something and you failure doesn't mean you don't get any. At least you still know why you failure and fix it. And get better and much better until you finish and successful.
