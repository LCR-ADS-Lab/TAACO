Working together is beneficial because it shows students cooperation and understanding one another. Students since kindergarten always had to do group work to learn how to share and work with each other. When students get older and are in different grades the group work starts decreasing and students start working alone. There is an amount of students that leave high school and go off to college or work and then their professor or boss tells then to work in a group and the student or the worker do not know how to work in a group. Working together in a group should be a skill accomplished in school, at home, at work, and where ever you go. Every single teacher in school should make a rule that everybody needs to do group work at least one time a day. Students schedules have six classes. Four classes every day and if every teacher said they have to do group work one time a day the students will have to do group work four times a day, and that also helps students with their communication skills.
