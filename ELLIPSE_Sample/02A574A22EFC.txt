No kindness mean that if you are mean person that will impact bad for you one example one small act is worth able because if you friend ask you to pass me out the book you can say you have legs that is the bad impact for you. Second example if you are a good friend you you will pass the book out to him that is a good impact. Always be good impact never be bad if someone sees you doing bad he/she will remember that your a bad person.

Once a pond a time I was going with my friends for a walk so I saw a men siting with a board saying i'm poor so I opened my back bag and I only had $20 so

I

only one 10 dollars bill and 10 once so I give him 5 dollars and all my friends got happy that I was kind so the men said that was a kindness of you and we all smiled. I always say what ever you do today and tomorrow you will get it so that means if your kindness today tomorrow someone will be nice to you.

Ok let's talk about "No act of kindness"

you don't need to be an actor for this but your kindness is everything if you don't have kindness you have noting try to be good to people like when you greet people so they know your a kindness person if your eating on a table and the people is a uncle you can ask them when your finish with your food I will pick up your plate then your uncle be wow he is a kindness person 10 years later your an uncle a kid was siting on your table and we was watching me at when I was finish with my food I was about to get up and go throw away my plate but the kid who was watching me eat he cam and uncle I will throw your plate so I remember 10 years ago I was kindness so I got it today. So we learn about kindness and my expires know we what is kindness is about.
