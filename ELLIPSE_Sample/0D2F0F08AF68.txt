Setting a good example of your own behavior is a good way to influence other; because, if you tell them what is good and what is not; that is going to help them to think more clearly. Example; If you tell them you don't have to do this....because this is going to affect you in the future. I'm telling you this because i used to smoked everyday. I had should listened when people told me "Stop smoking! smoking is not good for your health." so now here i am. i have cancer in my lungs. If i only had listened to my father when he always say; "son i dont want you to end up like me, please obey me".

This is one of a better way which a person should let others people influence them.

In my opinion this does not always work as a good infuence because you can let other people influence you by their own good experiences, for example;

if a person tell you when i was 19 years old, i was about to graduated from high school and i did not have no idea what i was going to do after my graduation, because i was not interest in any career, but then i decided to be a doctor even thought i didn't like at all and yes, i tried it. Now i am a doctor, i love what i do, i like my proffession, and you should do the same as me; choose a career i'm pretty sure you will like it and get used to it, but by the way you probably you wouldn't as the person said and you probably may regret to have done what they said.

So, I think both of them has positive and negative ways to influence others.
