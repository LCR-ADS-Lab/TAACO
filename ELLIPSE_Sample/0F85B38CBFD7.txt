Being successful is going from failure to failure with out giving up; it can one day lead to success.

in my opinion I agree with the Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Because being successful it's not easy to accomplish you will have to take two steps back to take one step forward. In the other hand some other people believe that successful is easy and that it's just a strait path with no curves, with no problem. some reasons why I believe failure can make you succeed are.

for some people money can be an issues and that can be a problem to become successful.

Another reason is the amount of effect you will be putting because you might lose interest and give up on the goal you set yourself.

lastly not having the right friend to support you to give you advice.

For many people money could be a problem to be successful. Personally this is also an issue that I will have to deal with once I graduate high school. I will have to go on and work to be able to attend a collage, but thats what I have to do to try and be successful. I will have to take a step back to be able to accomplish my goal and go to collage.

Another example is that to be successful you will have to put a lot of interest, because once you lose interest you start to lose hope and wont want to keep on going with what you had made a goal on.

and lastly not having the right friend to give you advise and or support you to accomplish you goals.

for example is you have bad friendships they wont incurige to on your school work or out side school. there people that might incurige you to do drugs only so that they can take advantage of you. they may be a reason why you are not successful you might not be with the right people.

In conclusion i strongly agree with Winston Churchill because to became successful you will have a lot of thing to do and get through a lot. others believe that success is easy that with no effort they will accomplish what they want in the time that they wan.
