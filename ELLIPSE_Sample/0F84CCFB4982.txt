I think is good take elective courses for the student , because if he want to graduate to the school , but if you want more gratuated in four years is better ,because you learning more knowledge is important that you learn.

if you take a decision studied ,studied because in your future is helping the stuied is good ,but the people don't like studing in my opinion is better take elective course , beacuse i learning more information.

example.

1. in my country all pleople speak spanish ,when i go to the salvador and i speak ttwo language ,i feel proud, my english is bad ,but all time practice and is important learning each day.

2. if you don't take elective course you not learn nothing ,because you are lazy you need studied is bettter your family are proud if you want a good title.

3. in your future, if you has a good title you have a good work. all people in this country don't have work and don't won money is because don't go to the school, whenhim was a children ,but we are a good oportunity in the shool, all student need studyng for a good future.

4. if the pepe don't to entrust ,you meed to prove that always to beat you and make feel the mother.

5. if you take elective courses in summer i think is bad , bacuse in the summer is not the same tha all year, all years you have more information is better ,but in summer id two months or three is bad .
