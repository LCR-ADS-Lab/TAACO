People who want to success in life have to failure more than once without loss of enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is important because is what keeps you doing what you want to accomplish. I strongly agree with the statement of Minister Winston Churchill.

I personally think that in life there is always up and downs. For example, when i got bad grades i always think on what am i not doing right so i can fixed it. However, to success in life you have to failure more than once but you have to know that there is going to be obstacles that are going to bring you down but you don't have to let them stop you because you have to think on what you want to accomplish or in what you want to success. If a person losses interest in something they want to, then they're not going to keeps going. In conclusion, you have to fall so you can get up and keep going to the goal.

Loss of enthusiasm can not give you success in life. For example, when you have a goal and there is many obstacles is because your close to get to rich it. However, you can keep doing what you love so you can accomplish the goal that you wanted. Although, there will always be somethimg that try to stop you but you don't have to let stop you. In conclusion, if you don't loss enthusiasm you can do whatever you want.

To success in life you have to think positive and act positive in front of anything that want to stop you. Although, you have to show then what you are capable of and what can you became if you don't loss enthusiasm. However, you have to failure so you can have a lesson and you can learn from that lesson. In conclusion, to success you have to failure more than once so you can accomplish the goal.
