Dose technology effects peoples life in a good way or bad way? Many people agree that that technology effects people lifes in a bad way. Why you may ask because people want technology to do everything for them. I think the oppsit, because technology dose alot of things that helps people like x-rays,computer,cell phones.

Technoogy has a negative effect on peoples lives, People start to get lazy they don't want to do anything they just want technology to do it for them. For exaple if they don't want to cook then they will use uber eats and if they don't want to shop at stores then they shop online. People depend on technogoy to mcuh for example there cell phones, some people can't live with out there cell phones. Some people lose their job because of technology advancing so much. For example couple years ago people use to make cars now day machines do it so people that had that job loss there job because of technology.

The use of technology has a positive effect of peoples lifes, People can do stuff faster and easier. For example if you have a paper to write but you missed school ad you did your paper you can just email the paper to your teacher fast adn easy. Also people cn learn new things tey didn't know. For exaple you forget how to get some where you can just pull your phone and search it up it takes les then 30 seconds to search. Also if you don't want to make contact with others you can just text them or email them. For exaample one day you don't feel like talking you can just text them.

After all I think technology dose more positive things then negative things. Technology saves lifes every day and makes peoples lifes more easier. I don't think anyone can go with out technoogy. also I thin we should all be thankful for the technology we have now days.
