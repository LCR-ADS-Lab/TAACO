Philosopher, physician and humanitarian Albert Schwitzer said "Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing". I agree with Albert Schwitzer, I believe that by setting an example by your own behavior can inspire, change and influence someone else to become a better human being.

By setting a good example can inspire the youth to change, some people take actions more seriously than words in addition promises can be broken but actions can be marked for example the word hypocrite defines the opposite of something that has been said therefor words can't be taken seriousy than actions; On the other hand actions can inspire people to do better, some people look up to their parents or relatives, not because of what they have said but because of their actions on showing good behavior.

By setting an example from your own behavior can also change people to become better human beings, in additon when some people are surrounded by the wrong group they are most likely to become one of them, for example if you're raised by someone who has a good behavior and a great personality, you are most likely to grow up with great behavior and being a respectful person, often it's not what you hear but it's the actions that you observe in other human beings; people can change because of the type of behavior that surrounds them, not always because of words that are being told.

Many people pay attention to action rather than words, It's easier for surtain people to become more influenced by actions; most of the time if you are being told not to do something wrong you are most likely to end up doing the opposite, sometimes no matter how hard you try to give someone a good advice they won't taking it therefore i believe that words are weaker than actions.

In conclution I believe by setting an example by your own behavior is a good way to inspire other people, it's not about words it's about showing good examples.
