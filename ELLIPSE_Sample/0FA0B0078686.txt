Is more beneficial work as a group that work alone because:

In groups is more easy to argument more about the topic because each student on the group gives a different opinion and also diferent prespectives of the topic,and that makes the group more efficient and also the response is going to be more efficient at the time the teacher grade it.

For example: A history teacher gives his class a project, the project consist in investigate the sevent wonders of the world, and the teacher makes groups of sevent students but one student decides to make it by himself, and the tacher agree with him, the group of sevent studens divide the work in each individual that is in the group, each student pick one of the sevent wonders of the world, each individual needs to investigate all about the wonder,incluiding the location and why is one of the sevet wonders, at the end they make a power point with all the information that they found and leater they are going to present in class.

Takes less time to finish the project (or eny other type of work),because with more that one member conforming a group takes less time to finish because the work is being divided in each individual of the group.

For example: Using the previous project example for the student that pick make the work by himself takes more time for he that the time that the other groups of students take to make the project done, because he do not have eny other student to share information or divide the project work.

More easy to grade, the teacher make less time grading the projects by making groups of students, because is more easy to grade a project that sevent students make, that grade sevent projects of sevent students that make the teacher spend less time grading the projects and gives the teacher more time to teach anothers topics.

In conclution is more beneficial work as a group because more students argument and gives examples,more creativity is maded and also is more easy to the teacher to grade it.
