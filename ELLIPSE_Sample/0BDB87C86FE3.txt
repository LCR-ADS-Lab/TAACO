Would you rather make your own decisions and follow your own instincts and ideas or would you rather get guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matter? I think I would want to get guidance from experts and authorities because it can give you different choices and opinions, can lead you to do the right thing, they know a lot more than you, and they make more experience than you.

Getting different choices and different opinions from experts are really important because if you were to make decisions by yourself than you wouldn't know their opinions. When you're trying to do something big you want to be able to hear everyone's opinions on it. You want to hear their opinions because later on you might regret making that decision and thought to yourself "why did I do this?". Ask for someone's opinions like your mom for their opinion.

Getting guidance can also lead you to go to the right direction because the experts would know a lot more than you because they are older and they are more experienced. They would tell you everything they been through and the truth because they would't want you to go through the same thing because they know how it fells to go down the wrong path.

They would also have more experience and more knowledge about it. The people who make decisions by them selves are later gonna regret doing what they did because they didn't get any advice from anyone who had more experience or who know a lot about life's matter. So before you make a big decision make sure to ask a elder or a someone who knows a lot about what your trying to do.

In conclusion I think seeking guidance from experts, authorities and elder are they best ways to get advice before they have a lot of experience or what they are talking about and they will give you they best possible advice they can, so later you don't regret the decision you made.
