I believed that we accomplish more if we are doing something instead of not doing nothing, by doing something it keep us being working out even when we don't know, have positive attitude, and trying to help other people

First, our body is working out when we are moving around doing things our muscles are moving and stretching, sometimes we don't notice but we do exercises in our arms, legs, well especially at work if we are moving around we do exercise, For example when we drop something we have to get down a pick it up, our legs is working out, to be healthy we have to move around do things we are going to get idle if we don't do nothing and we are going to be lazy to pick up things when they get dropped.

Second, when we are always moving we have our brain moving around and thinking, and thats good because we are not thinking on things that can hurt us, sometimes we forget that things that we were thinking by doing things that can help us, For example, someone wants to run away from all the problems, but the person has to go to work so while is working the person is using the brain in the things that he has to do at work, so while he is keeping he brain busy he is going to stop thinking by running away, we always have to confront our problems no matter how bad they are, we are always have to find things that we know that is going to help us to be safe and not by doing things that we regret when they already had been done.

Third,

by doing things we also help other people, we can support other people when they need it, we have to be helpful to others, we have to show that we care and we also want to help, by helping it shows that we always like to be doing things when we help people we receive a thank you, and thats good because they are thankful with us, because we did something that couldn done and that they wanted help.

Overall, I think the Thomas Jefferson wrote that to us to reflect and least do something, and yes is wonderful when do things by been idle is just a boring thing that we have to change and try to do more active things inactivity doesn't nothing to our lives.
