Our character is formed by the influences beyond our control. Our character is something that is made when were babies, most parents influence their child s character and most likely teach their character too. Character is also formed by the environment that we grow up in, for example if a kid grows up in a bad community he will grow into that community, but if a kid grows up in a nice community with nice people influences into becoming a nice person.

Character is a important thing to have, a good character and get you everywhere in life, but a wrong character can destroy your life. For example a lot of rappers and internet people were growing up in bad communities that they had no choice but to go with the wrong crowd. But a lot a athletes were raised in bad communities but their parents taught them right character to not be in the wrong crowd but to focus on sports and school and thats why their professional athletes.

Character can be influenced later on like if you moved to a better community or hang around better people your character can change and adjust into that community. For example one professional basketball player Demor Derosan was raised in a bad community but chose to stick to basketball now hes playing for the NBA and making a better life for his friends and family.

Some people can say we choose our character traits, because we can choose to hangout with people and change our lifestyle and character to fit them. I say thats incorrect because you decide to hangout with people that suit your environment and your character so its basically a universal way to be with a community or environment.

Character is a universal thing that you cant control, you may try to change your ways and environment but youll always have that character that your parents and community taught you and influenced on you. For us lets embrace our character and not change it for the bad but use it for the good.
