I agree having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. To have a positive attitude is hard because imagine waking up everyone morning with a positive attitude is hard. Because in this world that we are living you will not go a week without somebody having to mess your day up.

Having a positive attitude, can sometimes be hard for some people it depends on how that day begins in how it ends. Life has a lot of choices and a lot of path you have the make you own choice im make your path with a negative attitude you can never accomplish anything. If you don't know how to treat people; you don't know how to act than you won't get anything possitive out of that. At rhis point of time your attitude is everything you attitude well who you really are base on how you act, how you carried yourself, that will tell who you truly is.
