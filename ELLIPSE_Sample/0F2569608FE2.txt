i strongly agree with emersons statement. First of all, as an individual, you have freedom of action rather than being controlled by society. Being indepent help you focus on what is in our mind with no confusions. Next, self reliance people are better off their own. Self reliace person mostly do an excellent work on a project instead of being in a group. Though, he or she knows what is right, but as a group, they'd rather get information from everyone. Further more, independency gets you fast; far beyond accomplishment. Without uncertainty or lack of understanding, you're in the center of activity, and thats what makes you quick or have a good score on a project. Lastly, independent people are surprising. indivedual people do unexpected thing, and that's why it's easy for them to acoomplish what they want in no time.

in conclusion, individuality people only can rely on themselves. They know what they can do and what they can't. Individual people are deferent from others, becasue of their quility or character of a person or a thing.
