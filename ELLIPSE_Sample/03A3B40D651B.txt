One of the smartest people on earth said that "imagination is more important then knowledge". Do you agree or disagree with Albert Einstein? What do you think about imagination? Do you think imagination is more important then knowledge? I agree with Albert Einstein because if people focus on getting more knowledge people won't be trying to solve the problem with imagination. When more people come in to the USA then people or trying to stop it and not focusing on the students and staff that want help when in need. When people do their taxes the money goes to helping solve the problem so people should do their taxes to help solve the problem faster so kids can have go learning environment. The more the President wants to work on trying to get a imagination law to be made he should be focusing on the over things he ran for president not just one thing for years. The President should work on helping the people in need like sick people or the homeless and trying to help the homeless buy or get a small home to be safe in in so they can survive in the cold days and be clean and healthy. I mean having knowledge is good to get the job you wanted since you were a kid but i say it's better to work on imagination while working on helping people in need. I'm just saying that the President should work on lots of things and when working on big problem too. What do you think of when people say is imagination more impotent then knowledge? Think of it and the ask your self if you want to help out or not.
