I like to be a pilot in the future. but I can't see with my eye's that much good, and the pilot job don't eccept that if i want to be a pilot my eye's have to be good. So I Agree with Emerson's statment. I hope in the future that I can fix my eye's that I can be a pilot.

some people disagree with that, that I can be a pilot and my eye's not good or it dosen't matter. If I don't fix my eye's I will thinking with another job that I like to be on it. I like to be a dentist but this job so hard to be a dentist and it take's like 5-8 years to be a dentist but I will do my best to get a job that i like it and the job get for me more money. If I'm going to be a pilot it takes just 2-5 year to be a pilot and it's not that hard. I like this job so much so i'm going to do my best to be pilot in the future. I have three brothers Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name. Generic_Name like to be a Doctor, Generic_Name like to get something in the Computer's, Generic_Name like to be engineer and lastly I love to be a pilot.
