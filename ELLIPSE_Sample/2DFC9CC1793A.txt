I agree that loser can try to achieve success their are many types of loser who try and get success in around the world like in school some student can't pass the sol and some student pass quick in one time, but the loser who fail the sol first time he gonna try to achieve and pass in second time because every old man say never give up do it whit hard work, and do whit your heart then the success will come to you essylry.

Next, to be honest a lot of success can harm you because they can'tcontrol them self and invest their money anywere like in casino in Alcohol,Druges, and all that can harm your feature like your kides gonna be have so much money he will get everything what he need sport Car, nice House, so he will think i dont have to do anything he dose'nt have the stress on his mind to do somthing in life in small age he will smoke Cigrate and Drink Alcohol.

Then, if you control your success in right position your feature gonna be amazing like obama he is the Presedent of United State of America he have a so much power in his hand to do anything, but the most important thing is he know how to use that power he have big coltrole on his success he also have lot of money,but he don't have any bad habit like Drug or somthing he also made his feature good and he say to his two daughter he say to them go and find work for your self you guys can dependenton me you have to satnd on your legs and show the world what you can do every.

On the other hand, big example of the presedent of India first he was on the street he selling tea and he dose not have enough money to study,but luck is most important in our life his luck chang and he is the presedent of india he did so much stragle and hard work in his life and get success,but he don't have any controle on his success and he invest money on useless things and people in india say he is not a good for

India people hat him he higher the cost of fule,food,elericety,rent and more, and if he had the controle on his success India was gonna be like America.

Finilly, I campare both American and Indian presedent and see the success and failure power in my opinion the United State of America have the success controle power that's why people like to leve there and they also like there presedent,and India dose not have success power that's why people dose'nt like presedent,and they don't want to leve their, so this is the power of success if you use carefully you good but if you don't you die.
