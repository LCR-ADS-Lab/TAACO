Its a good idea to have year-round school because you will not be out of school long that will make you forget what was just learned and will always have help from teachers all the time.

Being out of school for a long time can make students forget what was just learned and it's true because many kids have reported that they forgot what they have learned in that year of school. Shorter breaks is the way to go because you will be able to retain the information that the teacher taught last week. This is another advantage that you will have because students will be fresh and will have more time to learn and study for upcoming test and would probably even make them a better student.

Having a long break is desireable by all of the students but it can also be a negative thing, Thats why having year-round school can improve many things for an example it can improve your grades, better focus and understanding, and better opportunities in life. It will even make the school at one of the best schools to go because the percentage of passing scores, quality of learning, and the best teachers.

This will not just improve and make students better at school but can also give them opportunities and chances in life. Education is the most valuable thing in the world without it this world would of not had influential leaders and inventors. This can open new doors in life and it can make anyones dream career come true not mattering their race or class. Having year- round school is the answers to many solutions.

In my opinion we should make a difference and have year-round schools. We have to make our youth in America into one of the most successful and brightest because they are the future of this nation.
