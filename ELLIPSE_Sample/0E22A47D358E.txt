I think we are accomplish more if we are always do in something,Because if you doing wat you have to be doing you going to get your stuff done. Because when you dont do wat you have to do you dont det nothing done,then you going to be worried because you dint get our work done.

my second reason is if you get your stuff done you can get a free time when you do all your work and it fells so good finishing all you work that you had. when you done you not going to be tired.
