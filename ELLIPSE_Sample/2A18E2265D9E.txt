I disagree that schools board plan should not have one and a half hours to schools each day. Some students hate some of their teachers because they treat them bad. Some kids would like to go outside to play with their friends or would like to play video game with online friends. Most of schools give student to much homework an schoolwork.

Schools give us to much homework and homework. Some teachers give student to much work in one class and things that we can put all of that stuff in are brain in one and a half hours. If you miss one day of school you will be hind in all your class because teacher give us to much work. Student would get bad grade if teacher give us to much work to get us behind.

Some kids love to go outside and play sport with their friend and just to have fun. Some teens and kids all most play video game everyday to play with friends and online friends and they do not like schoolwork. Kids love to go outside,teen love to play video game all day,and no one love to do schoolwork and classwork.

student hate some teacher. When teacher are mad they make the student do more classwork and homework. Some time teacher will said stuff behind you. This is why student and teacher fight because the teacher make s up lie that the student did this but they did not do it so now the student get very mad at the teacher.

This is why school board plan should not have one and a half hours to schools each day. Teacher makes up lie then the student are mad. Kids love to go outside and teen will dead for video game and not do homework. Teacher will make us do more work because they have one and a half hours.
