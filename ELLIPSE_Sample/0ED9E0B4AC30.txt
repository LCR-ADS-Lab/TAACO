I prefer to work alone, because i can focus more and not get distracted by others. Working with a group can be helpful , but some people do more work than others and at the end everyone gets the same credit. This is why i prefer to work alone, so that can get a full credit for the work i did. For example many student's like to work in groups and it takes more time than working alone in my opinion. Students that work in groups can get distracted very easily by side conversations, in the other hand students who work alone can listen to music or go to the library where it's nice and quite. I get a lot of work done working alone than working with groups, because when i'm working alone i get in zone in my mind where i'm like super focused. I be wanting to do more work alone and time passes by quickly, this is why prefer to work alone. this one time i worked with a group because we had to be in group's and i barely did any work to be honest, because there was no competition and i didn't feel motivated at all and i still got the same credit as the people who put in all their hard work into that group work. This is why i prefer to work alone.
