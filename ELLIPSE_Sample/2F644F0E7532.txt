Yes I am agree with Churchill's statement. Because to be successful you have to start in the bottom.

Every time you fail its a new thing that you learn, don't be afraid to take the failure to turn its an another ways, the ways of success. Without failure to loss you're not going to be successful at all, you have to take the risk to fail. This is why I am agree with this statement.

Success without no fail is not a good success, it's not going to be a long success, you have to learn from your mistake, that the next time you can make it better, you do know when you are going fail, but you can feel the success you make the right thing by learn from your step down, do not worry about people say, don't give up in you dreams. Always remember that you are stronger than what you believe, you are smarter than what you think. Don't take advice from a person who take the wrong ways, if you do they are going to lead in the same ways with them.

Always looking for someone who can give you a good advice, who can give you a great example of success.

Always have a plan B if the thing goes wrong.

You can't be successful without any loss, and i think it's would be better if you start losing first, because if you fail,

again, and again you will take something form the negative thing that you fail, to make its an a positive ways to be success.

Minus plus minus equal positive, you can combine the failure to make its the ways, you think its will be good for you. Success mean everything, the thing you do where you started until where you are right now, you will never stop learning.

The Former British prime Minister Winston Churchill statement have a lot of sense, because success always consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.
