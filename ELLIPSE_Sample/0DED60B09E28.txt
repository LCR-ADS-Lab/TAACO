However honesty can hurt other people feelings because they told you something and somebody else teels you that what that person said you have to be honest so you tell them because you don't wanna lie to them because they won't trust you and your gonna be a lier. for example my brother told me something and my mo asked what he said i had to be honest if would of lied to my mom she wasn't gonna trust me so i apologize to my brother now he trust me and i am not gonna tell any one what he tells me now i am honest to every one they can trust any time because i am honest. i see people lie alot and i don't like them because they lie so i don't become friends with them because if they promise i get something from me they will never bring it back because they lied they promised but they mean it they will just take you ask for it back there are not there what kind of stuff they will take from you is money,your car,video games,tv,speaker any thing they will take from you. i seen a lady not being honest and acting like a homeless lady at the end of the there just a normal person they just wanna lie like they have a house a car money they have every thing but the will still ask people for stuff just don't wanna be honest. i use to be a lier now i changed i am not like that any more so i quit lieing now i am honest. in the past i have lied alot and one time i got in lot of trouble so my parents didn't trust me for like about two weeks or one week what i tell them they would say that i am lieing but i wasn't i was telling the truth but they didn't trust me so i apologized to my parents and they trusted me now i am never gonna lie agine. if sombody lies to you leave them alone they will go to some one else and lie to them if you become friends with them they will steal from you and lie.
