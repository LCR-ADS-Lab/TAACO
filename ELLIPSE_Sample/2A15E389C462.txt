I agree with it because some kids might need help with what they are struggling in. The help they will get will help them know the subject or even homework better. Not everyone knows what to do or know it at all. Most kids can go to get more better at it so will know how to do the homework or something a lot more better.

They need help on their homework that they might not know. The teacher that gave them it might be there to help them out with it. The most helpful thing is to go to it because you never know that you might learn something ne mean while your there. Most kids can't learn as well as the other kids because the reason behind that is that their brain doesn't lean as well as the others.

Some kids might go to know the subject better and the homework. Some homework isn't the easiest to do. There are times where people that forgot the homework but if you go do it there an give them it. The reason some kids don't do it because they don't know it or don't have enough time to do. Most of the time most kids try their best to do and some do even try to do it because they say they try and try but there nothing on it because they don't know it.

Most of the kids in the class don't remember how to do it or if there sick they aren't going to know it more better then those in the class room. Most of the time it's because the kids are worried about someone or something that won't let them focus on what they have to learn. The way for them to improve is to see if they are focus on their work and if there not the homework club would be the best thing for them to lean and not worry as much.

There for I think that the home work club would be a good thing for them to improve in the subject and know the homework a lot more better. The club would be for the ones that need help and want to improve in the class they have a hard time in.
