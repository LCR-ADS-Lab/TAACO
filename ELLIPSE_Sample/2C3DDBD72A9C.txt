when i started school, i had to do everything alone, why? you may ask. well my parents weren't alway home and my sister never had time to help me out with my homework because she had her things to do around the house and school. I had to teach my self, force myself to become the person i am now.

I agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson Quote, " to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment." being yourself can get you to places that your couldn't even imagine, it not necessary to change your personality just for someone to like you or get accepted in a job. In this world no one going to like to see you accomplish something that they probably couldn't. People are going to hate on you, criticize you, treat you differently. It like a latino artist rapper said, "haters go down and we go up." I personally refected to this quote because, when i started highschool people would hate on me, just because i would get good grades in school, i would get along with everyone and be myself. Everyone wanted to see me fail, everyone would attack me with mean things. At one point i was doing terrible in school, my relationship with people was horrible and it all happen because i was trying to defend myself, but everything would go wrong. When 10th grade started everything turn out different for me. i had good grades, pass all my classes and look at me now graduating early, accomplishing things that everyone that hated on me didnt wanted to see and just see me fail. i did that with faith of God and also my self, confident, and just being myself.

Being yourself is the key to everything, get told to be someone your not it taking you to any good, we are just getting push to something that we can get to huge consequences and regreted for the rest of our life. It better being a leader then being a follower.
