Generic_Name is a 30 yeras old, he is a man of business ,when he was study he funded a little company with his uncle but the cumpany broke with the locking of experience so he make a effort to learn what was the problem and learn about the failure, 4 years ago he recupere about the bad experince that he haved in the pass and with a more experience he is a big businessman. So the succes consist of going to from failure and get alwys enthusiams.

For example when I was in the school at mexico. I was haved a soccer team, I was play for school during 3 years well always prctices with my teammates and the coatches when was a big event a level state my school my participate and another 200 hundreds school, we payed 8 games and we won all my school get to the semifinals so there was when we lost the firts semininal me and my teammates with the face sad for the failure , the failure get to us more experince and united and we won the trophy but the most importand was to representative the school and get the nane on the top of many schoolso if yourself no failure you can't learnd about the lost and find the success.

Another example is Raul, he is a famose singer ,he talk to the peolple an interview before to be a singer, he wanted be a good doctor, he was a good student always he focused a lot with the school and i the work also his parents help to hem and was soy prime about his son but he don't was accepted and any uniersity for lack of study he failure at the work of his dreams that methot guided to hem to follow anothers way he was haved a talent to sing he tell was at one club in the school and start to create music now he is one of the top of the more famoses artist.

Inconclution. Some people belive the failure don't have a play with the succes becuse they think the people who have succes get that without of problem but they are wrong aparrently I see many famoses and businessman tell to an interview tell to the people that they was failure many time, favor to that they learnd getet more experience and follow others away for get the success that they have now.
