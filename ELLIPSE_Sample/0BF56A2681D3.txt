Dear, Principal I think students should do community service because we have to keep our schools clean. We should also have community service because it will help people be cleaner by picking up after them. The community service is very important because if know one picks up the trash that's in school then our school is going to look ugly. I think you should get people to pick up every day and then for the next day get another ten people and be rotating every day. Its also necessary to help out the community because we don't want to have a dirty environment for our children and younger kids. That's why I think we should have community service most people think its not important but years later it will be important because our children are going to be the ones living with a bad environment . I think we should have community service for these reasons because if we don't clean up right now no one will clean up in the future and that will hurt us because we are going to be living in a bad environment because no one wanted to clean up . In the future we are not going to be able to smell oxygen because of the bad environment. These are all the reasons I had to say about why we should have community service. Thank you for listening to my opinions. Sincerely, Your Student
