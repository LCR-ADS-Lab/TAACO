I disagree with the school boards plan to add a half hour more to the school day. I disagree with because I think that the time we have for school is great. We get a good leaning time for all classes we have in the school. I also think that when kids get home from school they should have the rest of the day to work on homework,and other school work they have to complete,and when they are done they can go outside with there friends and family. They can work on there school projects when they get home from school. But there are still are some good things that can happen if the school board add a half hour more to the school day it can give kids more time to finish there work,test,note,and projects,and they can ask the teacher for more help. But they can stay after school to ask the teacher for more help and finish all the classwork that they did int finish in class,and they can just finish there test and there note when they stay after school with a teacher. So I think that the time we have for school should stay the same for those reasons so please don't Chang the school time.
