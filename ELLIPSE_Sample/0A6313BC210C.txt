I strong agree that all students in schools should be required to take music, drama or acting class . These classes will help student with low self steam to open up, these class should be taking more seriously to every students and parents because the more support the more they grow and with the help for all these teacher they classes will be more surprising. Drama and Art they or two unique subject with drama its help u talk more show your true emotion with all they pain i believe all these classes pay a major role in ours days students life so in my opinion these classes should be graduation class so no matter who it is they should do these classes before they can get there diploma .

Meanwhile music class help kids to be calm music block out all that negative that comes our ways with music and drama classes kid can be free they you can come there to talk about anything with these classes is a open class u share your topic you share what on your mind you can just be free with these classes so all students should joining. Its always good to try new classes to make u a new persons.

Drama classes is all about acting so act your pain away its the best thing to do for example Generic_Name been having a bad day he dont talk to nobody he recent got in drama class so Generic_Name doesnt talk to nobody he stay to his self he see he aint the only new person in the class but its doesnt matter because he still aint talk to nobody, He see everybody talking to each other trying to make friends and Generic_Name didnt want to talk to nobody so the teacher told everybody to say something about there self with everybody trying to get Generic_Name to talk he finally felt confined and start talking so drama class actually help you to talk and open up with yourself .
