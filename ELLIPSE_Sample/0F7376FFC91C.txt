I think doing science experiments are more enjoyable becuase you get to try new thing see what some different things you can do. stuff that you never did before in class you can did it somewhere else. it will be enjoyable to experiment with stuff you never did before that will be an enjoyable thing to do i know for a fact that other students would love to do that like come on who would not love to do cool sicence experiments with their friends that will be super cool dont you think!!! if i was you i would enjoy doing sicence experiment maybe by the end of the day you will love to do sicence why because you already learnd about really cool experiments you can do in science. so i think that doing science experiments will be enjoyable for everyone if you want to play an instrument yea that will be fun too because you are learning songs and learing how to play your instrument soo much better but i still think sicence experiments are better becuase of all the fun you can have instead if just sitting in class all bored and falling asleep instead of doing that you can be making cool stuff with different chemicals but be care in every science experiment you have to be really care because you dont want to get hurt during a experiment .
