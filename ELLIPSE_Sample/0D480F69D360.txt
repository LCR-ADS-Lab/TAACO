An activity you might like can be skating there are many skate parks near you, the community provides many outdoor activities like sports or hiking, there are so many activities to choose but you have to pick a good one, and be prepared do not go skating with out your gear or go camping without your camping gear that would be terrible. A fun activity is hiking that can be a very enjoyable way to spend time outdoors, hiking can make you get rid of stress or distractions it makes you feel relieved of everything, plus it also helps you exercise like having to walk when it is very hot outside it will make you sweat. Something that you can learn from hiking is how nature works you might come across any unique animal or insect you might see a different type of bird flying filled with many colors or a duck because there might be a lake nearby or even a terrifying animal like a bear, but most importantly is for you to have fun and your family.
