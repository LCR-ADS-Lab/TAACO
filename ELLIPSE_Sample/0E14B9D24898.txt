I think that the curfew is good idea for adopting because at least sudents will not dying on the streets and they will not be no loneliness for them. Teens would not braking the law if they were not in big trouble. For teens there will be no street fights, crime, shooting weapons, etc. The curfew will take care of them at least temporary or it depends. Government need to take care of homeless teens. Those who drop high school early is too bad because some students desided do not learning and try hard their subjects. They will not success in future without educarion. In real world no one need them because they are not educated, did not complete high school and there are take care by themsellve on the streets. After curfew they leaving,

found minimum job with payment good for them, at least teens did something in their life. Their big mistake that ignor, lazy, skiping school, worse grades, attitude, not respect, selfphone and etc. If teens will not changing their minds, posobility well end up in wrong way. But I hope that they will succeed in future.
