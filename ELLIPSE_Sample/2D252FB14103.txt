The principal is planing on changing the cafeteria food to Heather food .I disagree the school lunch shouldnt change to healthier food; it would't change for the better it will change for the worst . students won't eat the food which will make the loss whit,They will go home hungry . The parents would be upset because the there kids not eating and being hungry . student will not be healthy anymore because of the whit loss. The students can pass out because they didnt eat. They wont be doing will in school their grades can drop because they wont have the energy to be in school .

If the students don't eat the food the food would go to waist and with will have to throw it away and that will cause the schools to loss a lot of money. since they want to change to Heather food the healthy food would costs more money. the students won't eat the food so it will expire and it will be thrown away. it would be a waist of money . The money that was spent on the food could have ben spent on other school activitys . yes the students will be eating heather and it would help them learn to eat heather. but there kid and teenagers they wont lesion . They dont like Heather food they dont understand that healthy food it good for them so they wont eat it.

students that drive to school will skip class to leave campus to get food. If they do it everyday for the rest of the year there grands will drop extremely and they could and the posoblaty of not graduating high schools. They will have to repeat the year and the school could get overly populated. patients will see whats happing and they won't want to sent there kids to school some parents will want to home school there kids or but them in private schools. thats why schools shouldn't change to Heather food it could cause a big problem
