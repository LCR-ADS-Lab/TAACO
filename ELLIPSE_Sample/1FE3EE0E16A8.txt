Success is not just for perfect persons, sometimes we need to fail for to learn how to be better and learn from our mistakes to succeed and reach our goals that we have in this life.

Every single person in this world make mistakes that means to me that no one in this world is perfect, but we need to learn that is part of learn in life, is something about to be better every day and the enthusiasm is part of learn about our mistakes. It is important to fall down and don't loose our hope because that hope and the enthusiasm make us better persons and that is our impulse to succeed and make our dreams real. We need to think like a winners no matter what is going wrong in our life, take our weakness and make it strengths. My mother once told me because you loose one battle that doesn't mean that you loose the war, that show the importance to don't give me up at any bad circumstance or bad decision that i took before in my life because no one in this life born with all knowledge or born perfect to don't make something wrong. She also show that i have to do my best, to give my hundred percent at whatever that i want do because that is what make us better persons, she show me that don't give me up, be dedicated and passionate in all that i want to reach.

Failure plays a important role in succeed because that is how the apprenticeship start at, what if all scientist they were gave up in their experiments just because they did something wrong in their experiments we probably would didn't have medicines or the cure to a lot of illness or all technology that we have in the actuality or the first people that worked for the NASA with their first rockets that they made it, they get on fire and burned up but they still tried out again until they reach they dream to be the first persons to go to the moon, all they learned from they mistakes, that was the key of their achievements, that is what made us humans learn from our errors.

Is important for us to fail but is more important to don't give us up, to follow our dreams and believe in our self in our own capacity that we are able to be better in whaterver adversity and solve all problems that life impose in our way that is the key to achieve all dreams that we have, not all in this life is perfect but with effort and enthusiasm we can choose the right way to go and found solutions to our problems no matter the adversity just trust your self and do be afraid to be wrong because failure what inspire us to be better and succeed and learn from our mistakes.
