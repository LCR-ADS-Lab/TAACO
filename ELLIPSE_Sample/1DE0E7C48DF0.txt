I know not all of us may have experience in every way. For example i may not be experienced in everything but as long as someone is their to hep me i will be wiling to work and do what is needed.

Some jobs look for the days they need their employees, Most places won't hire if you dont got what the job is actually looking for. Its better to find a place you find comfortable working at. Most jobs require-

certain age experience availability

Mangers go for people who they see doing good in their job. For me i know i have job myself and it wasnt easy to find. I had no experience i didnt know anything. I was trained like every other employee at my job, But now i know a lot more positions. If my manager is low on staff he knows he can rely on me to come in and help, better for me i make more hours which makes me makes me happy knowing I'm making money for myself.

Its better having a job where you get along with your employees. Find something your really interested. Dont choose something is gonna make you miserable.

One day their is gonna be job youll have where they pay more then you will get paid for a part time an youll probably get more then $8 of course.
