One topic that is frequently debated is that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Some people agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. I think that failure is not just loosing, is something that didn't know how to do something that can help people try harder. Some time being successful does not mean being great all the time cause some time is hard to keep being the same all the time. Being a failure is not a reason why people should make fun of others cause they can hurt other's feeling.

One reason failure is not just loosing, is just that some time people don't know how to do what they have to do and by that they think that they are failure. Some time when people see others that they need help instead of helping the other person they start laughing. When people can't do something they start getting mad at them self and they can hurt them self.

Second reason some time being successful does not mean being great all the time cause some time is hard to keep being the same all the time. Everyone can be successful one day but not all time cause is not easy. Sometime people try to make other look at them like they can do everything but sometime they can't do something and they can get upset.

Final reason being a failure is not a reason why people should make fun of others cause they can hurt other's feeling. Some time people can really hurt them self cause other make fun of the person that made the mistake. Some time when people are really mad at them self they can react bad and hurt others.

As you read being a failure does not mean just loosing that's not something good because that can cause someone to hurt them self. being successful doesn't mean being great all time cause is hard to be great all time without error. Some time people can make bad decision like hurt them self or react bad and hurt others.
