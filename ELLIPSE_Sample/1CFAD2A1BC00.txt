I think that it would be good if we have a after school club because, some students might need to finish up some work there missing. Now let me tell you why it would be more good, first you get to do it in groups and make new friends in the homework club, it makes you more focus in the work that you need to and you can even do it with a group, solo, pairs. and after school homework club is perfect for all those things and it raises your grade up.

all you have to do is...

(1)Ask for your parents permission to join the homework club. (2) try and finish up the work you haven't done yet. And now your done. It even helps the school by you making the school a school where student can grow and learn. if you ask any teachers from our school they would all say that homework clubs are good to help your brain learn more and release that stress that you might have from not doing your work in time and homework club helps you in that.

as a student my self i to have homework and test, and other stuff and sometimes i don't have time to do my homework at home so sometimes i choose my days that i want to stay in homework club for example lets say you want to join a club but you know you have a lot of important work missing then dont choose other electives just choose homework club and then you can choose the elective you want, and with that we should all have home work clubs in each school.
