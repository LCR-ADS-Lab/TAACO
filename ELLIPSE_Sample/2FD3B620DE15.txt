Dear, Principal

I oppose that students should have a B average to play sports. Because some student don't have that grade so they cant play. However, other students have a C because maybe they are having a hard time in their classes. Also the B student don't but they don't try that much in sports and the C students do and they like to stay active and have fun.

They can also take the team the are playing in to win a trophy. Another reason is that C student maybe try hard to get at least an A but they have trouble doing that because they don't get the lesson that their teacher explained or they don't get the homework. You should at least put the C students that try hard and always do their homework and if they don't get it.

They can still try to do what they have trouble in and ask questions to his/her teacher the next day. Another reason students with a C average grade should be able to play sports is because maybe they have problems at home and they are nervous that something might happen and they don't do their homework that's why they also don't get high scores in their tests. Because they are depressed and they are not in a good mood.

I have to say some students don't even try at school because they think they don't need a good education they and just get a job. Well, other students do try but like i said earlier they have are having hard time in school. Like they are being bullied by someone and if they say something to a teacher something bad will happen to them.
