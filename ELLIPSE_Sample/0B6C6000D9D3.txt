Should Churchill's statement about the role that failure plays in the prusit success don't give up, try again and don't let people said that you are loss.

I desagreee the Churchill's statement failure because they was so enthusiasm to gain. For example some group when they don't gain the games they relapse.. Should Churchill's statement about teh role that failure plays in the prusit success don't give up, always try again and don't let people said that you are loss.

To begin with, Should the Chuchill's Statement don't have to give up. They have to practice more and get more better. Churchill's statement don't have to belong. In addition they need to improve a few people can said The Churchill's are loss but they have to disassemble the people. For example some group get mad when they don't wim then they give up.

The second reason, Churchill's Statement need to continue try again because in this life we always have to try. Survival to go ahead and try again. When i group loss everyone feel bad. For intance failure in not a error because many people make mistaken in this life nobody in perfect in this life.

Lastly,

People can said The Churchill's are loss but the group have to teach the people in not like that. Never listen what people said. A few people like to see the group sad. For example some people can say the group not play good people change to the other group who win.

To conclucion, they don't have to give up Churchill's Statement have to disassemble to people that can doing also they can be strong don't go down. Group have to improve and practice more and not listen what people said because people like to talk. When the game failure i know many people feel sad and the people who support the group they are sad. But never give up.
