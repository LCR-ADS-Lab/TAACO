Should the school extend the school day two hours? It depend of the schools and the parents, if they approve the extending of the school days and also see if there is any benefits or disadvantages of this.

In my opinion it can be a disadvantage for some students, because some of the students have to work after the school and they will not have time for do the homework or projects or even their own free time, and that is why they don't have time for do it,but the most problem of this is; if the parents of the students are going to approve or not about this change to the school, because some of the parents take the education of their son or daughter so serious, and that can be one of the big problems to the schools.

But there is too benefits for students or some students only, because they are going to have more time in classes for learn more and also for do the projects in the classroom and not in their houses as homework.

Another benefit too is they can have for time for the activities in the school if that was as a class they have.

I will approve and disapprove, because there is so many disadvantages of this, but to the same time there is benefits too about this change of the school.

But in my opinion, I'll disapprove this change, because I'll don't have time to do my homework or have time for me.

And that is what I think about this change and the advantages and also the disadvantages.
