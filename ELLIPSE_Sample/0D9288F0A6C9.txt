Schools should extend time by two hours because students will have more time to do there class work. If a students have more time to do there class work then they will not have there class work as homework. Having more time in school means that you can get your work done and have extra time to do othere class work. In my old school we only had seven hours of school and we have eight classes in a day. most of the time we barley had time to finish ower class work so we had to finish it as homework. We also did not have time to do labs, expirement, and project. Thats why having more time can help us do all of those things. Another reason would be is that teachers will have time to explane to students things that they do not get. Teachers have time to explane things to a students and help them under stand more about what they are learning. In the movie Matilda students there only had six hours of school and teacheres did not have time to explane things to students. Students only went to school, tooke notes, and went back home. Sense they had no time at school to do class work they had a lot of homework. Most of them did not even finish there home work becauses it was to much. At the end of the movei students had took an exam and they had the whole six hours to finish it. When the time was up ninde persont of the students did not finished so they automaticly failed. if only they just had more time, more students would have passed the exam. Another reason would be that having more time can help students is that scientists prove that having more time added in a school schedual will help students incress there acidemic by ten persont. That means if i spend more time in school learning i will be come smarter then students with a regular schedual. Having more can help students finish work they would not normaly finish when they have a regular schedual.
