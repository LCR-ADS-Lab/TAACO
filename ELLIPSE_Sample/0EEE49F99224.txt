Some people believe that you don't identifying your career at a young age is a bad idea. Although some might believe that identifying your career choice at a young age is good for the future. The reason behind this idea is, students are expected to identify a career bt hte time they enter high school, some good high schools helps the students, with the courses they taking, as a high school student they talk to their parents or counsellor about the career choice and what college to choose.

In my opinion identifying your career choice as high school student. Because parents and counsellors looking forward to what career i'm having in the future. And identifying what is the best college for me to attend, because of my career. But the hard thing about this idea is that you got to study hard, worry about all the tests you'll take in the future, and trying not to let your school and parents down.

In conclusion identifying your career in high school is a benefit for my future.
