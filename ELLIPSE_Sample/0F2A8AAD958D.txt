American Juzz legend Duke ellington said, "a problem is a chance for you to do your best". I agree with this statement because it marks you life, makes you strong, and it show the word you can do it. now problem can be nad but if you try you will overcame them. because chow would the world be if we did not have problems? it would be boring right. 1. problems mark your life and make you strony and cofedint about your self because you are shoiny the world you can'don it and thet you have the power to do it and that no mutter what gets in you way you will oucreome you problem. 2. problem make you strony and the hurder the problem the stronger you will get. now sometimes you will feel like you cant no more but giving up is not a choise you have to keep on tryng and think of positive thoughts because if you have negative thoughts you are going to fuil to your problem and you want be able to get any stronger heither will you show your best. 3. showing the world you don do it and that you are strony is what is going to make people see you as a roll model. because when people see that you are positive person and that you try and if you fail you keepon tryng and that nothing slops you they will start to admire you. and what you have to keep on doing is not giving up so they can keep seeing you as roll model.
