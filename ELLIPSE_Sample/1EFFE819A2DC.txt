Emerson's statement about individuality has been discussing by many people over time. Altought, some people disagree Emerson's statement. Nevertheless, Emerson's statement is in complety reason about individuality, because many people can enjoy their jobs and enjoy their lifes.

At this time, 6 of the 10 people hate their jobs by the influences of the people around them. For example, my aunt hates her job as a cleaner houses because she was influenced by her parents of do not go to the college in just focosed to work. She always comes tired and mad because she does not like her job. This shows that if my aunt did not led her parents influenced her taking a job that she does not like it. She probabily do not be mad and tired all the time. Clearly, the most important accomplishment that you most have is been yourself and taking your own decisions.

In this world exist many people trying to make you something else and people that forcing to be something that they are not. For example, people that lie about their sexuality in just because their family or friends do not accept them for whom they really are. You can see in the tv many cases of bullying to people that are homosexuals and many of these cases end with the life of that person comitting a suiced. This shows that many people took their lifes because they can not enjoy their lifes been something that they are not. Oviously, people get tired of people that are trying to make them something else.

In conclussion, Emerson's statement is good for society. Because people can enjoy their jobs doing something they liked or appacionate. Also, people can be free been what they really are and enjoy their life. For all of these reasons the greatest accomplishment in this world is been yourself.
