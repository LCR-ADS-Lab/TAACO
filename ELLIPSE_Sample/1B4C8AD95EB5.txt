"Unless you do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow up."

I actually agree with this, because some people are just stuck with what they do , and they don't want to try new things; they are just so used to what they have been doing for years, so they are kind of afraid of doing something new. It's just like making new friends in school. Kids are really used to their friends that they rarely talk to new students. This might apply to Ralph's words because some people don't really want to change their routine, or because they dont really wanna change their life style at all.

Another example but a little more personal would be me, I love riding my bike, I feel like I could ride it for hours without getting tired, I tried to do skateboarding for a couple months but I ended up going back to ride my bike, because I was already used to be riding my bike so I stopped trying to learn how to do skateboard.

I would say that it's like a feeling of being afraid because we think about it, we think about it's pros and cons and we also try to adjust our schedules to see if we have time to do something that's not in our routine already or if we can just replace it for something that we already know how to do. I feel that to succeed in life we have too be willing to try and or to do things that are new for us like a new type of sports, a new hobby, even a career as long as we are interested on them.

Where I'm from Eni Ayuwoki means "do and get stronger" back there people use to believe that if you do more than one thing that is helpful not only for you, but for everybody in your community you would be the most important and recognized person in the area.

So in conclusion for me that makes sense because I dont really enjoy having the same routine every single day, I like to switch between activities to keep my mood up. I don't think anybody likes to do the same thing over and over again.
