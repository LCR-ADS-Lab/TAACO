I disagree,because sports shouldn't have to be a "must",doing sports or staying after school to participate in something should be optional,because some people aren't able to do sports or to stay after school because some people have to go home and take care of their brother or sister,or have to deal with something at home.

Some people do sports out of school too,maybe they don't do sports but they do something else like ballet or dance,swim or boxing there so many other things out of school to do and it could be to much pressure for students to be dealing with school work,staying after school and it could be more pressure if they do something else out of school it could cause them to fail at one of the many things they do.

You also have to think of other people who don't like sports or they are just not good at doing sports. I feel like doing sports or staying after school to do another activity should not be a must,staying after school to do sports or other activity should be a option it should not be require.
