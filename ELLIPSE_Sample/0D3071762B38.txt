Thomas Jefferson was right when he said "Determine never to be idle ...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing." ,because If we not working hard , and we just sitting down not doing anything we can't get successful in our life .We can't be lazy and think that everything going to be OK and nothing going to happen,life don't work that way we have to work hard and do everything we can to get to the place that we deserve ,and then we can rest because we reached our goal we got what we was working hard for,but still after you reach your goal you can't just stop and not do anything , you can rest but after you rest you should set for yourself a new goal because if you just stopped and became Idle your life just going to stop and you will lose everything you did,but by working harder your life going to be successful , and you not going to have to worry about anything because you're doing all you have to do and not being lazy, you will active a lot more than you was going to active being Idle.

Life not going to be fair if you been an Idle and you accomplished what you need , and then you going to be equal with whoever worked hard and never stopped it's not going to be fair at all, whoever work more gain more.

because if we just be idle life going stop and nothing from our goals going to happen because we not working on it ,so if you don't work on your goal you will lose it, and your life going to be useless and doesn't have a meaning.

All of that could happen if you been an Idle and inactive in your work al of this could happen to you without even knowing your whole live can change in a blank of an eye.

That's why we should work as much as we can right now because there will be time you will not be able to do anything, and you will need money and you will with that you've done everything while you can but it will be too late to do anything.

"It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing" Life going to be great if we always doing stuff it doesn't matter what are we doing but it have to be something good like help others or work just don't be lazy and do nothing ,this is how life going to change and be hard on you you can get a lot of stuff done if you work but if you get lazy everything going to be difficult for you, and not just for you for everyone close to you because when you get to a level that you need help and they can't because they got work and stuff you do they will feel bad for you and for themselves because they couldn't help you.

All of this stuff could happen if you been lazy ,but if you work hard and do your job right you will be successful in your life and in your career whatever you doing it doesn't matter if you are a student or a grown up and got a job all that matter is that you do whatever you doing without being Idol because if you did all your accomplishments going be over all your dreams and everything you dream about going be gone by the time you realize ,and you not trying feel how bad that feels.
