I can't had a B average because i have soccer practice when i got home it about 9 o'clock and i have to eat something first and i have about 3 or 4 homework to do. the hardest one is Math. when am doing those homework i even fell am sleepy , when i looked my watch it's already past 10:00 so i have to sleep to wake up tomorrow at 6:30 and take the bus at 7:00. The best thing is the soccer practice is really hard the coach made u run about 5 or 6 laps on the soccer field, and u getting tired and u have to play soccer at the last time. many people arguing and the quite there sport they love an i wrote this letter is u to understand me not only the other student that's having the same problem as me._x000D_
