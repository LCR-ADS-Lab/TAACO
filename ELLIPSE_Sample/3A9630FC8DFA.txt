After elementary you go to middle school, Then high school, And then collage, But what's next, what do you want to be or when do you want to be after collage you get a job go to work make money, or even have a family,

Now lats talk about elementary school for a sec elementary school is important right because that's the first school you ever go to, you learn how to speak, write, read, make friends, and learn about plants also animals and more fun thing to learn about,

then it's middle school, more two grades 7 and 8, its just like elementary school but it gets you ready for high school.

Now it's High school is the big place you learn about new things, And get your drivers lie sens, your GP, learn more about collage and more things you never learned about, join a club like, football, soccer, facts, coreiss, singing, band and more.
