50% of people say that when you have a problem that its a opportunity to do your best but others dont believe that. "A problem is a chance for you to do your best." I agree because you can prove to your self that you can solve your problems with out any help.

Having problems is giving you a chance to do best. For example, when you have homework and you need help but you want to show your parents that you can do it with out there help just do your best and never give up on your self. Also, you can be doing a quiz and your stuck just do the best and move on.

Sometimes you my feel stuck or confused but always do the best you can. When the teacher is asking you a question and you are confused you can always just try your best. Another example could be like when your taking a test and it has multiple choice just try your best and mover to the next question.

Some people think that problems is a chance to do your best but some people do think that but there are problems that you can have but you just have to do your best and never give up.

You can sometimes have problems but always remeber "A problem is a chance for you to do your best".
