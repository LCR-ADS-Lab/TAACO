In the journey of life, you will have to do the majority of things by yourself; your family, friends, or team will not always be there for you. Work as a team sounds much easier, but some people take advantage of that;

the whole team got a good grade in the project, not mattering if one of them did not work, put effort, or participate, he or she will receive the same grade as her or his team did.

Generic_Name, a 17 years old high school student, who always decided to work alone in all of his classes. Everyone in his classroom works in teams, groups, or partners, but he was different; many of his classmates thought of him as a picky, delicate, and rude boy. Generic_Name found inner peace by being in his own, made him felt comfortable, secure, and proud of doing his projects by himself, because when the time to step up in front of the class and explain his topic comes, he would be sure of what he was saying. Sometimes you need to be alone, so you can find your inner friend or skills that you didn't know you had.

Some benefits of working alone are that is your own opinion, no one else have to say a word, and even if you are wrong is your own fault that you have to learn and go through it. Lonely means a lot of things, and people take that word in a mean side; sometimes you just do not want to work in groups, because you know that you are capable to do great things on your own, without the needed of selfish, noisy, or stubborn opinions.

You can measure yourself, and by working alone you are doing it; you are creating an idea in your mind that is just you and that is how It is going to be in the future, so you are preparing yourself for the future by being working alone.
