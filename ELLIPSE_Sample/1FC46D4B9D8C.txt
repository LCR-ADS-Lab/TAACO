Positive attitude is the key to success in life.

I gree with the statement of having "positive attitude is the key to succes in life". Becuase people with a good positive attitudes enjoying life better. examples of enjoying better life with a positive attitudes are: people being more pation, respect on all, and hey live life with having less headache on their brains.

People who does not have a positive attitude in life, they are not succes to enjoy life in pace. one clearly example of people who does not have a positive attitudes are: they are always conflict with them self,

they being disrespect to the people around, and they also are in more trouble and able to get headache constately.

Another reason, why I agree keep positive attitude? is because a good positive attitude is also healful to our self and we do not hurt or offend other people.

Positive attitude such as a special key to make life better, more healful and to treat other people nice.
