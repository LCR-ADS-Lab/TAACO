Do we choose our own character traits or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? In my opinion we do choose our own traits, Here's why.

We have met so many others with similar and different character traits in our lives that it has shaped our own. We all have our own personalities, with our own mindsets and goals, which causes us to choose how we act. Especially after a heart break, That can change someones life. It'll have a person wanting to change for the better, but can end up worse and have a bad outcome. Therefore we choose how our lives end up.

We have shaped ourselves into who we are today. Our attitudes says a lot about us. Unlike some people who have an ugly attitude, but its only cause they got influenced to act that way; It just means they were trying to fit in cause they got their feelings hurt before. Especially social media. Social apps can make us more insecure about ourselves, and not want to talk to anyone, Therefore it changes our perspectives on how we view ourselves and it makes us want to change our appearance.

Although our characters are kinda formed by influences, Like how we are raised, our environment, and our choice of friends. Growing up with parents that dont care what their child does can lack manners, respect, and love. Which will make them turn to gangs, drugs, and violence. The environment we grew up in takes a huge toll on our life. It defines who we are. Also our choice of what kind of friends we have can influence.

So do we choose our own character traits or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? Do we follow other people in their footsteps and copy them, or are we solo? Cause I believe we do choose our own characters.
