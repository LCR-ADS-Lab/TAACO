Dear principal_x000D_

what are community service: is when people come together to help make the community better. helping the community is very important. i think our school students should be required to perform community service, instead of waiting for the school cleaners to take away the trash and clean up the class room at the end of the day. i think students should do it them selves. you can help taking part of community service for example: cleaning up litter, sweeping the lunch room after use, picking up used trash. community service is not meant for school alone there are different palaces community service could take place for example : you house, your neighbourhood, anywhere around you that is need to be clean. i know students have something better to do like, their homework, play video games, i think there is time for everything. and students should always take part in anything that would make their community better and cleaner.
