I will feel better working with a group, because I don't have to do all the work everyone can put their own words, and if I mess up on the work I will have people to help me with my work. I think working with people is good you meet new friends they will help you doing your work, also you can help them do there work if they need help, and it's great to help people when they need it. If you work alone you would not move on with your work, and no one will not help you so that's why it's better working with a group, and not working by your self. I do support working in a group like i said in the first lines that working as a team will help you as a good leader, and smart with your work, because it shows you what a great person you can be by helping other, and your team mates helping you when you need help. Lets be for real when you work alone it will be hard some times when you are doing your work, because you will run out of ideas your teacher might be doing something like helping other studtens with there work so thats why I say it's better working with a group, there's going to be days like that when the classroom is going to so busy that your teacher will put you i a work group.

Yes I know people that like working in a group, but it's for the best for people to try new things meet new people talk have fun when doing your work, just be happy, because when I work in a group I feel happy I know I can talk to some one if I get stuck doing my work,

and it's just a good feeling when working with good people. I use to hate working in a group, I thought maybe one guy will do all the work in just turn it in, and thats not going to fair for us, because he might tell the teacher that we never help him to the work in he did all the work by him self, now that i work with a good group of people I don't have to worry about that happens to me. I still support my ideas about working with a group, everything did I just said it's true it's happened before when i use to work as a group you have to trust people some times is going to hard to trust people like they say you can't Jude a book by it's cover, because you will not now what a good person can help you on,

like school work or anything that you need help on so thats why I still want to work in a group even though they may not want to do the work, but thats why you work as a team to get people working together, because you don't want to let your team to get a big F because you didn't help them to do the school work. It's really cool to work together, because when you turn in that big school work, and the teacher checks your work everyone will get a big A every one will be happy, because they know that the group help out with the work so now they know that when the teacher, tells them to do the work they will know which group to work with, and pass so they can go to the next level of there school grade, or applying to go to collage, in collage you will be working in group, because it's going to hard when doing collage work, I seen people going to a room and, start working together as a team doing all there work asking each other which one will be a good word to put in the paper work, thats why I like working in a group every one helps in put there hard skills into work, and I think it should be that way help each other to get a good grade so they can pass collage, and start doing the jobs they work hard to get. Know it's not going to be easy, but trust me when you work as a group you know you are going to be in good hands knowing that people will help you if you get stuck on the work, they can come in put there ideas in, all that skills they show you will help you in the future when you start going to harder classes, but for sure theres is going to be a other group that will help you if you get stuck in a school work that your teacher gave you.
