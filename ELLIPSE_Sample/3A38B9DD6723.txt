In every success of a person there is always a humble story of how did they start from the beginning of their journey. At some point, being successful does not mean you have gone through a lot of struggles, but it was destined for you to be successful. In every story there are different types of story because it is based on where you came from, what education you have finished, and your status in life.

However, I agree with Churchill's statement because success comes after failure. Failure is really an important role for every success. If I fail, I did not hesitate to stand back for myself to pursue success. The greatest blessing in my life is being successful after I have gone through failures. For instances, Graduating high school, I won't be graduating if I did not fail and try harder to reach my goal. At some point of my life, failure is within me because I am not making any move to pursue my planned success. Planning ahead of my success is not bad actually it prepares me to become a successful individual, if I will fail at this time maybe planning my success is not a good idea because it was planned and I know what kind of success is waiting for me. I'd rather be a failure with clean conscience than a successful cheater.

I conclude that in every success of a person is within you. You hold your own fate. If success is really for you be thankful of what kind of success you are receiving at that moment of your life. Be humble, keep your feet on the ground. I will end this by saying if you fail once, stand up twice.
