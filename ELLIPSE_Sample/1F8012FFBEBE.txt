I think that the principle is being unfair because students are actually trying there best on having good grades. I think he should give them one more chance because there trying there best . If you don't do nothing about them we would were going to sign a petition and were going to get the whole students get it sigh even the teachers. If you still don't let them play a sport then were going to get our super attended on this and i know he would do something about it because he's nice. He's going to see that were trying our best on our grades._x000D_

So either you want to do it the nice way or you want to do it the bad way? Its your choice were just letting you know before we go and do it the bad way. Its not fair that you taking our sports away from us that's the only good thing we have in school and friends so please I'm asking nicely don't take our sports away from us._x000D_

We promise were going to try our best on getting a better grade then before. We promise were going to stay to tutoring at least twice a week if we have to we don't really care because we don't want to loose our sport._x000D_

We fight for what we want please give us another chance?_x000D_
