Dear principal, i think that bringing phones to school is ok as long as we don't use them during class time. Me STUDENT_NAME is telling you to please let use the phones during free times because how about if we have an emergence and we need to call our mom or dad and we cant communicate with them. It would be very hard for use because we also have to have our own time to communicate with others in case something bad happens, So im telling you if we can please use our phones in lunch, nutrition or in other free times. We the students have to have the free time to. But we also have to be careful on not be using the phone during class time to. If we do then you can cancel the policy but if we actually do good we can continue with it. You never know, we might even do good in this and we can keep on doing it but if we fail, You can stop it. I'm telling you to just give us a chance to see if it dose work out.
