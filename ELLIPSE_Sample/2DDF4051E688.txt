I disagree about forcing students to join the afterschool club. The principal can't force students to join activites. Activites have more sports and other clubs and everyone can join in each one of the clubs or more. the students doesn't want to join the extracurricular activites, some students have jobs. But every student wanted fun outside of the school, so people don't feel safe and fun while they are in school. Everyone had plans afterschool to have fun. So the principal wanted the students to have fun in the activites. But the principal wanted the students to participate atleast 1 activity and they are allowed to serve the council or work on the yearbooks. But forcing students is like a bad idea, its not the student choice to join the afterschool program. But they can choose the club that they can join. I think its a bad idea to force students, but I think that joining an afterschool program is fine. So I think I agree and disagree at the same time.
