I agree that " A problem is a chance for you to do your best." (Duke Ellington) because I believe that this statement means that even if there is a problem there is a chance for you to improve next time.

One reason why I agree with this statement is because you can improve for next time. For example, let's say you are having difficulty with one of the subjects you're learning at school and you have an assignment due the next day. So you try your hardest on this assignment but when you turn it in the next day you score a low grade,and you go ask your teacher if you can make up that assignment but they say no. Now in this situation the student can learn for this and take this as a chance to improve for next time.

Another reason why I agree with this statement is because something unexpected might come out of that problem. One way is that let's say you are doing a group project for on of your classes and there's a few people in your group that aren't contributing to the group. So you decide to try your best to take the lead of this project and try to get everyone to express their ideas. This shows how a group of student go through a problem with people not wanting to participate but then the student decides to take the lead of the project and try to include everyone.

My last reason why I agree with this statement is because you can do your best on something. One way you can improve the way other view you is by trying your best to solve that problem. For example, if you are having trouble with something then you can try to ask people you know are a teacher for help. This is so you can find the best solution to your problem and do your best.

In conclusion, I agree that " A problem is a chance for you to do your best." (Duke Ellington). Because there are many ways for you to learn from this statement,such as you can learn for you mistake and improve next time,something unexpected for that problem,and you can do your best on something.
