I agree that students should be requerid to take a music, a drama or an art class, but I think some students don't like this type of class, becuase they learn about other classes.

In my opinion, that students that be required to take a music, a drama or an art class that good for they, because they can practice after school and they dont think for to do bad things or going to the street with bad influence. Also, that students take some of this class can learn a lot, and may be they can benefit from all that they learned , and someday can teach to other students or people;

they can be a musician or can be a star in hollewood. Overside, the schools have to think about that students that they don't like this type of class, because may be they wanne to learn other lenguage or this interesty and other type of class, but sometime they can't take that classes because they can't take classes electives.

In my conclusion that schools have to take measure that help the students to take the classes that they like and can beneficial for their future, and also can do programs about music, a drama or on art class; in this way some student can like this type of class. I learn about this topic that we can take out advantage to hte music, a drama or on art class for our future and learn more things.
