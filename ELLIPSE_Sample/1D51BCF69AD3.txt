dear principal,

i think all students should bring their phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times , but they have to turn off the phones during class time. It is very important to have your phone with you , if you feel bad, you can call your parents to pick you up . Some students use their phones during free times to text people or call parents ... Everyone needs to bring their phones , if you need something , you can call someone , even ask the teacher if you can use it if it is very important . But the students who use their phones during class, playing with the phone , or showing the phone to their friends , that's not a good thing because the other students needs to concentrate. Always turn it off , because if it rings , the teacher will take it ,because its annoying , that's his or her job to take it and give it to you at the end of the period .

Sometimes the teacher don't understand , if you are really sick , you ask him or her if you can use your phone to call your parents, they wont let you and they would say'' you ! stay because this is more important , copy what i wrote on the board ! '' Every teacher does that , i think you should to talk to them , let us use our phones when we really need to call your parents !
