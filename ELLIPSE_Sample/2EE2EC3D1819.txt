When unless you try to do something beyond what do you have already mastered you will never grow.

I disagree with

Ralph waldo because when you have something ready you don now is if perfect some times you do something wrong when we try something beyond we don't know the result already we can do fist and we can get the results we dont not before finish the work.

Some people say when you try to do you work you can get good results and they say not body is perfect we can get something wrong because when people masters they have something wrong is you work we can do everything but we don know the result because some times people decide if you work is good and some times people dont like you work and other peoples like .

Some times when people working in different project when you stay younger is probable you dont do good but if you try you can do then you can grow and get master and when you do more time you can get perfect and get a good results .
