Don't lose enthusiasm in your goals, failure is just a little bump down the road in life that teach you how to do or make things better.

I personally agree with Wiston Churchill's promp "Success consist of going from failure to failure with out loss of enthusiasm".

Therefore; many people fail on their way to reach their goals but by being persistent and not losing their enthusiams they will success.

Most people fail to succeed in their goals.

Every single person in this world has a goal but most of them go trough many tough times and failures before completing them.

For example, I failed my driver license test 3 times, my goal was to past it so I can start driving. So I did it but a fail a few times before completing my goal.

I felt like a such failure every time I didn't past the test, but I did not give up. As results, after studying during day and night time without giving up I accomplished my goal. Failing to me is not the end of the world, it just motivate me to do things better everyday.

A person must have love, passion and enthusiams to be succesful.

Many people work hard and with passion in what they love the must. For instance, my stepfather (Generic_Name) a great business man when he started his company it was a total caus for him.

The company was not popular and was not selling products. Generic_Name went to bankrupcy onces but loving what he does and without giving up, he stands up to work had to have succesful company.

IMPAK his company is one of the most popular in selling plastic products in the United States.

would argue that you don't have to fail in order to be succesful. On the other hand, 98% of succesful people fail before reaching their main goal.

By doing what you love the must and not giving up on it is the main goal in life.

In brief, don't just give up on your goal just because you fail a few times. Complete them in order to be a successful.
