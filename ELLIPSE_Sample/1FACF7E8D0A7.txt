Dear principal_x000D_

I do think that students should be require to perform community service. The reason why I think that is because every one should be helping out the community ._x000D_

where we live is like a community that we need to take care of and not keep massing with it. If we mass up this world where will live, people just throw stuff on the floor, not picking after themselves. We should not be forced but we should do the right thing and be happy about it. People do a lot of things to help out the community, and we all should join in and help out like ever body ells. I would love to help out the community because i want to make the world a better place live and we all should give out a hand. So students should be required to perform the community service.
