Why would we add another hour and a half to school? I say we should not add 1 and a half hours to school. Some reasons are because school is already boring with the hours we already have, kids may have things to do in the afternoons,and it may be too much time already in school we don't need to add more time.

First, I think that schools should not add 1 and a half hour to school because school is already exhausting, and many kids are tired of it. They have to wake up early go to school and stay seated for at least 5 hours. Many kids can't stay seated very long so its very difficult for us to stay seated for that long. And when they get to school they are all tired

Next, Many kids might have plans in the afternoon and if you add more time to school than you might be disturbing there free time. Many parents are very strict so kids may have a curfew and adding more time will make them have less time to enjoy themselves. Also if they have family things they have to do than school is interfering in the way of them doing their personal things.

Finally, We already have too much time in school. Many people say that most of your day is in school, and they are right because we arrive at 8:00am and dont leave until 3:15pm. Kids already don't like the time we have to be in school so why should yall add more. Many kids will just always complain about the hours in school.

At last,

Many kids find it boring, they think we already have enough hours at school, and they might have personal things to do after school. So in conclusion thats why think that they should not add an hour and a half to school.
