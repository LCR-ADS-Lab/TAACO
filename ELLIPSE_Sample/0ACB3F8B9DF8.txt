I think it does keep them out of trouble it protects them. When teenagers are out in the street its could be because they are doing something bad you never know what they could be doing after 10pm or midnight. I never hangout by myself at that hour unless im with my parents or at a family party, there is no point to be out late at night but many people dont care and be out late at night many teenagers dont obey the laws.

Its important to have curfews, it keeps teenager from being out at night. In the weekend teenagers may hangout late with a friend or cousin but it really depends on how strict the parent is. I have really strict parents they won't let me out at night, unless, they are with me. its important to make new laws to protect the envionment and the teenagers as well teenagers now a days think they can do whatever they want. 10pm is kind of late its close to midnight maybe during the weekends teenagers could hang out after midnight but during the weekdays after 10pm would be against the laws it really depends what they are doing like are they driving in a car or walking its scary to be out at night by yourself.
