I agree that there should be an after school homework club, because some students need extra help with homework others just need to be encouraged to do it. Honestly I don't think anyone likes doing homework but you have no choice for example me, I hate homework it's the one thing in the world that I do not like. I like the idea of homework clubs and I hope my school decides to have one. It's a great way for students and teachers to get to know each other better. it's a great way for them to express their feelings. They also get help with subjects they are having trouble with the teachers can brag about their students having good grades and the students make their parents prod so it's a win win for everyone. I'm 100%

with this idea because. Plus they should allow the students brig their own food, Snacks etc. It should be every other day Homework plays an important role of school and if you don't do it, it can affect you in bad ways. over all I feel like teachers have gotten nicer than in the past they help their students succeed, Teachers have come a long way to make sure their students pass their classes and go to collage and find a good job. teacher are always there to help you and they can't do that if you don't show any effort. you have to show them that you want them to help you if you are doing the work but don't understand it they will help but if you just sit there and don't do anything they feel like you don't care.
