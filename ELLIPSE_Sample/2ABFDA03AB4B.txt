To my view point, yes, because so the parent could stay more focus to theirs childrens, also, they could feel more comfortable in your house, Also, Some childrens that they like more privacity, it might be a good idea, some facility the technology, and this always will follow ahead, this could be a way of we go adopting to it. For example, if you need travel or to do something important that really need it, you can go to the sitweb and check what you must to do; another reaosn is that they will not need go with their bainder, you can go just with your computer, you would have more organization thank to the apps that the computer get and you could save your notes (today day many people forget the papers, and this is more easy to lose it), how the computer need some conection to wi-fi, you can navegate by red and search something that you didn't understand, the navegation have many way to facility you life. However, The teacher would put more atention to each students, because I feel that best expresion is writting and the teacher will gave more trust to the students and they are apen to talk with them, and the conection to talk will be better (curse talking in person is very different but they wouldn't open their mind, and they would a close mind, because some reason is that they are not feling liberty, some reason are their partners in your classroom), For this reason, I think that this will be a way easily to keep your ''good grades'' and the atention to the students wil better.
