Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week to conserve energy and resources, With each day consisting of ten hours.

Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours?.

In my opinion should not follow this model extend. Student can not be with a family dinner every night, some student are involved with sports, clubs, and other activities.

End of the school day students need to do their homework. Some parents they like their kids to be in the school four-day school week, each day is ten hours. But, some parents think their kids needs expires them self, visiting a good friends spending a wonderful time after the school. In mathematical way we like to simple fay the numbers of equation from big to make it small , and also we can use the equation in our life. However, In the math; eight hours for each five days is helpful for students, gives them enough time for read, and writ. Ten hours for day students get fostered from the school, and from other activities. I can imagine how difficult for any student who work and stud , to be an independent.

This kinks of school businesses are not large in our society thankfully, even they like to be in that kind of school again, I dont recommend to spend forty hours a week for four-day . Do you?
