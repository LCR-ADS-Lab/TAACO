Schools should not control these types of student involvements, these decisions should be left to the families and students.

-The decision for a student to be involved in an activity does not have to deal with school control. If students want to get involved into extracurricular activities, schools should not have to control these types of problems.

-It's the student's decision: If the student signs into a football club after school, the school should not control what time you can spend on the club. If the student signed into it, it's because the student wants to spend time doing an activity. He or she will have time to do his or her homework later, or the student can sign into a homework club after school. This should only depend on the family, not the school.

The student obviously has to have time for school and homeworks or assignments. So if the student wants to be involved on a club, he can choose to go to homework clubs. If a school does not have a homework club, and the student wants to be on a club after school, he can:

Talk to the conselour about how to manage the student's time with school and assignments.

Talk to the conselour and ask him/her if it's possible to change any of the student's classes for a CORE class at the beginning of the year, so that the student is able to do homework or any other assignments.

Some days, whenever the student has a project or a big assignment, he should choose to not go to the club only if he has something really complicated or important that requires more time at home to do assignments.\

In conclusion, students and families should be the only ones to control how much activities or time they want to spend on a club or doing assignments, schools should not control these types of issues. Let the student decide.
