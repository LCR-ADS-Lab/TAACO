Yes I'm desagree because somen times when for example one friend he talk with you about one gril and he thinking she is ugly but one day you walking and you see that girl your firts impresion is she its beautiful she it's not ugly my friend it's not true because he told me about she it's ugly but not she is not.

One day my father he told me about one salvadorean and Hondura's restaurant, and he said in this restaurant they make the best food. One day I say hey father I need to go to this restaurant because you told me one day about they make the best food so I gonna know if is true and he said okay let's go and when we are readdy for buy food I go to the casiller and I say can you please get me one baleadas please and the casiller say of course. And 5 minutes later the food is readdy I eat the food and when I done I say yes father this food is very good. So my impression not change because when I see the food i say omg this food is look like very good and I true.

The first impression its somenting personal is when you see somenting and you can felling if is good or not good this it's the first impression.
