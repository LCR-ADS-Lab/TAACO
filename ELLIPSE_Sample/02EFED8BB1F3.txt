Did you know that school boards are planning to add one and a half hours to schools? Adding more time to school days is a bad idea because, the students are not going to like it, the students are more likely to get anxiety, and the day is longer.

First, the students are not going to like it because, they have more work to do, this means that students are less likely to participate more in activities that are good for their health, they will also intend to get into more fights, this will lead to the schools score to drop and less people are going to want their kids in those schools and they are going to collaborate in putting bad scores for the schools.

Next, the students are more likely to get anxiety, kids that have anxiety are the ones that are more likely to go the wrong path, this leads to more kids doing bad stuff and getting detention and

IASD,

kids with anxiety are more likely to skip school, and they wont have anything good for their future. Kids with anxiety also tend to get bully more, this means that at one point they're going to think about committing suicide or hurt others for what they have done to them and create even more bad reputation for the school board or the country itself.

Final, the day is longer, having a longer day is bad for students because, students have to work more, this means that students have to work as harder as before, and they wont have enough time to sleep as before, this leads to students sleeping in class and teachers calling them every five minutes because they dont get the time that they need.

In conclusion, the majority of students are going to disagree with the idea and cause a lot of trouble, they will also get high levels of anxiety and are more likely to start smoking or do drugs, and now the last but not the least is important is, the day is going to feel longer and students are going to go to their house and not sleep because they have to study even more for all the work that the teachers left them, this means that they wont get that eight hours of sleep necessary to carry a healthy day.
