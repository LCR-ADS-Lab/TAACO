I really like this quote because, i believe this is a problem that basically happens in many homes and also many society of people. Being motivated to become what they dont want to be and what you dont have the passion for. Therefore i disagree with Emersons statement; Why? Becacause i believe everyone has a choice to choose what they are passionate about, not what the society or the influenece of their parent saying I see a doctor or an engineer in you. Having the love for a profession or a study is one of the greatest thing ,you feel like you are living everytime you figure something out,you feel happy and motivated to take it futher to you reach the top. When someone is passionate about a profession,studing of a language,writting,discovering,healing,helping people,anything in this world i believe they should be motivated. Not brought down by making them do something else because its not healthy physically or mentally i believe. An example is ME.I have studied business almost my whole like since i was in my country,beause i wanted to be work in any field of business. Last year i moved to the united state and my parent and everyone around me said i should be a nurse,but i dont have the passion for nursing,but with no support on my side i decided to be nurse,and mentally i feel like it√¢ going to be difficult, and i always bring my slef down when i thing about it, but if it was something i had the passion for i wouldnt mind the hardness i will just concentrate on how i will make it and and believe in myself that i will surly get and will also be very determined. That√¢ what i mean by being motivated and supported to do what you want and do what you love is really great.

So i disagree with this quote,some people will agree because they believe your society or your surrounding makes you who you are. But i believe the society and everyone around do not make you,or can not stop you or influene you to do the opposite of what you want to do unless you give them the chance like me or you take your stand and let them know why you want and love this thing and it will be a great honor if you accomplished it .
