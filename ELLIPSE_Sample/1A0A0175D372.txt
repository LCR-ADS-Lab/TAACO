I agree to being honest because if you ever lie to your parents its not cool and you have to be honest at all times that's not only parents its to everyone you see and you should't hurt anyone feelings as i said you should agree with me because life isn't all about being a lies,

And if anyone asks you that have you ever lied to anyone you gotta be honest to the person who asks you those questions those are asked to see if you are ever being truthful to everyone,

So one day you were walking around the park and some kid comes to you and ask's if you want to 1 v 1 him in basketball tell him that honest that your not that good at basketball but you could still play with him,

And I was asked to pick up trash from the floor to save the earth day and but I had to became honest and I said I got to run some ares for work and I gotta get some grouches for the house and i wanted to buy a new game for my Xbox life is all around the world for some people,

I was at work and my boss was talking to me and he had asks me why was I not coming to work for past few days and I had to be honest i told him i was sick and had the flu for the past few days so then he was like are you feeling bit better i told him i feel so much better,

you should't be mean to people and that for you if you do you going to be a bad person and no one like you,And that's why you should agree with me to always tell the truth like sometimes,however,honesty might hurt a person's feelings.
