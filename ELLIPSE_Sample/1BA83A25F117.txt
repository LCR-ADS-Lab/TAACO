Not, attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing that will not help, because today at day student are so much using tengnology (internet) they will cheat when they are doing the work (test) and they just want to play video game.

If they can not go to school that will be a big lie that they gonna do it from home because at home nobody want to do anything, just sleep and eat, and there is a lot of distraction more if the the student have a little brother or sister there is sometimes where we have to help our parent to take care of them too, will be better to sacrifice a little big more using the bus or train or they parent bring it to the school or wathever, because in this life there is nothing easy to do,

We have to improve to have a better life it does it matter the distance of school everything is posible when we have goal in our life, for the future of our family, !our parents want to be proud! that in the future we can be people who have a great job, and that can happen just going to school
