Good morning firsrly i want to say that i agree with churchill's statement because we do not has to loss the enthusiasm per anything we always has to believe on us, even if you has dreams you has to work hard to be someone better on this world, show to everyone what you can do with success.

Even if you give all of you try you can see the success, if you fault one time keep trying second time can be, most persons they thinking just because you fault one time that you are going to fault all of the times, when i see someone which think like that i give encourage to him and keep trying.

Sometimes i feel tired to keep trying, but i never loss the enthusiasm to learn more because if we has that enthusiasm we can support someone which loss the enthusiasm, i can motive that person to keep trying.

I support my dreams because i want to has alot success on my way to make my family feel proud of me, i like when i see my family smile that is my motivation to always try my best, to get good grades and pass the tests that is how i make myself to feel enthusiasm.

It also mean you can go straight do not matter what the anothers persons thinking about me, just keep going and try your best you can be bettter that the person too, the best trying is when you are working hard on something you want, when you has the enthusiasm which you puspose to manage.
